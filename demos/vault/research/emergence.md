# Emergence and Complex Systems

## Key Principles

### Emergence
- Simple rules create complex behaviors
- The whole is greater than the sum
- Patterns arise without central control

### Examples in Nature
- Ant colonies
- Bird flocking
- Neural networks
- Market dynamics

### Application to Knowledge

Traditional knowledge management is top-down:
- Rigid hierarchies
- Predefined categories
- Central taxonomy

Emergent approach:
- Organic connections
- Pattern discovery
- Self-organization
- Evolutionary growth

## Implementation Ideas

1. Let users create simple links
2. Patterns emerge from usage
3. Algorithms detect clusters
4. Insights bubble up

The graph becomes smarter than any individual's mental model.
