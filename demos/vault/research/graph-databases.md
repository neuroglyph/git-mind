# Graph Database Research

## Traditional Approaches

### Neo4j
- Cypher query language
- ACID transactions
- Heavyweight (~200MB)

### ArangoDB
- Multi-model database
- Document + Graph
- Complex deployment

### DGraph
- GraphQL native
- Distributed by design
- Operational overhead

## Why We Don't Need a Database

Traditional graph databases assume:
1. Centralized storage
2. Complex queries
3. Real-time updates
4. Multiple users

Our approach:
1. Git IS the database
2. File system IS the index
3. Commits ARE transactions
4. Merge IS conflict resolution

## Performance Comparison

| Operation | Neo4j | Our Approach |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Startup | 2-3s | <1ms |
| Memory | 500MB+ | <1MB |
| Query | ~10ms | ~1ms |
| Storage | Database files | Git objects |
