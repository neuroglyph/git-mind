# Knowledge Graph Research

## Academic Background

### Semantic Web (2001)
- Tim Berners-Lee's vision
- RDF triples
- SPARQL queries
- Never achieved mainstream adoption

### Google Knowledge Graph (2012)
- Entity recognition
- Relationship extraction
- Powers search enhancement
- Proprietary and centralized

### Modern Approaches
- Roam Research - Block references
- Obsidian - Bidirectional links
- Logseq - Hierarchical + graph
- Athens - Open source Roam

## Why Another Approach?

All existing tools:
1. Create new data silos
2. Require specific apps
3. Lock data in databases
4. Add cognitive overhead

Our approach:
1. Works with existing files
2. Uses Git as backend
3. Data in plain text
4. Zero lock-in

## Key Innovation

**Git IS the knowledge graph**
- Commits = temporal dimension
- Branches = alternate realities  
- Merges = synthesis
- Diffs = evolution of thought
