# Chaos Mode Concept

## Inspiration

What if we let entropy in? What if the system could make speculative connections?

## The Gonzai Engine

Named after our chaos monkey mascot, this mode would:

1. Analyze content similarity
2. Detect semantic patterns
3. Create speculative links
4. Mark them as "chaos-generated"

## Example Scenarios

- Two documents mention "performance" → possible connection
- Similar paragraph structures → might be related
- Temporal proximity → co-evolution of ideas
- Anti-patterns → contradictions worth noting

## Safety Mechanisms

- Clearly marked as speculative
- Confidence scores
- Rate limiting
- Easy bulk removal
- Human review workflow

## Philosophy

Sometimes the best discoveries come from unexpected connections. Let the system dream a little.
