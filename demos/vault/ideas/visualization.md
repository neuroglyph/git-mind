# Visualization Ideas

## Graph Metaphors

### Constellation View
- Nodes as stars
- Links as constellations
- Brightness = activity
- Distance = semantic similarity

### Mind Map Mode
- Hierarchical layout
- Collapsible branches
- Color by category
- Size by importance

### Timeline View
- Temporal x-axis
- Vertical grouping
- Animation through time
- Change highlighting

## Interaction Patterns

### Focus Mode
- Click node to center
- Fade unrelated nodes
- Highlight connections
- Show metadata panel

### Explorer Mode
- Free navigation
- Multiple selections
- Batch operations
- Pattern detection

### Presentation Mode
- Guided tours
- Storytelling paths
- Auto-progression
- Speaker notes

## Visual Encoding

- **Node Size**: Number of connections
- **Node Color**: File type or age
- **Edge Width**: Link strength  
- **Edge Style**: Link type (solid/dashed)
- **Proximity**: Semantic similarity

The graph should feel alive and responsive.
