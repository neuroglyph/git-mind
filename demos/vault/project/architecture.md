# System Architecture

## Overview

The system is built on Git's content-addressable storage, treating semantic links as first-class objects.

## Core Components

### Storage Layer
- Git objects for immutability
- SHA-based content addressing
- Plain text format for debugging

### Link Engine
- Bidirectional relationship tracking
- Type-based categorization
- Temporal awareness

### Query System
- Graph traversal algorithms
- Filter and search capabilities
- Performance optimization via caching

## Design Principles

1. **Git-native**: Everything is a Git object
2. **Human-readable**: Plain text formats
3. **Distributed**: No central server required
4. **Fast**: Sub-second operations

## Integration Points

- File system monitoring
- Git hooks for automation
- Plugin architecture for extensions
- Web API for visualizations
