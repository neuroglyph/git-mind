# Neuroglyph Demo Project

This is a demonstration repository showing how GitMind tracks semantic relationships between documents in a real project.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a hypothetical distributed knowledge management system. The repository contains:

- Project planning documents
- Technical specifications  
- Research notes
- Meeting minutes
- Ideas and brainstorming

## Key Areas

- [Project Roadmap](project/roadmap.md) - High-level timeline and goals
- [Architecture Overview](project/architecture.md) - System design
- [API Specification](specs/api-design.md) - Technical interface details
- [Research Notes](research/) - Background reading and references

## Getting Started

Use `gitmind list` to explore the semantic connections between these documents.
