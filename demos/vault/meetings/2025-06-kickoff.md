# Project Kickoff Meeting
**Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Attendees:** Team

## Agenda

1. Project vision
2. Technical approach
3. Timeline review
4. Role assignments

## Key Decisions

- Go with Git-native approach (no external DB)
- Start with CLI, add web UI later
- Focus on developer workflow first
- Target March for first release

## Action Items

- [ ] @alice: Draft technical architecture
- [ ] @bob: Research prior art
- [ ] @carol: Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] @dave: Create demo repository

## Notes

The team is excited about the "Git as cognition layer" concept. We agreed that speed and simplicity are paramount - no bloat, no frameworks, just pure functionality.

Next meeting: Design review on June 10th.
