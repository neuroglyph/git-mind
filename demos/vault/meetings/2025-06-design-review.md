# Design Review Meeting
**Date:** June 10, 2025  
**Attendees:** Team + Architecture Council

## Presented Designs

1. Storage layer using `.gitmind/links/`
2. SHA-based deduplication
3. Plain text format
4. CLI-first approach

## Feedback Received

### Positive
- Love the simplicity
- Git-native approach is clever
- No dependencies is huge win
- Human-readable format appreciated

### Concerns Addressed
- **Q:** What about performance at scale?
  **A:** Linear scan is fine up to 10K links, can add index later

- **Q:** Why not use Git notes?
  **A:** Too hidden, poor tool support, harder to debug

- **Q:** What about merge conflicts?
  **A:** SHA naming prevents most conflicts, Git handles rest

## Decisions Made

- ✅ Approved: Current design
- ✅ Approved: Start implementation
- ⏸️  Deferred: Web UI until CLI is solid
- ❌ Rejected: Database backend

## Next Steps

- Begin C implementation
- Create test suite
- Document decisions in ADRs
