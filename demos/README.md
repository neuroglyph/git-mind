```

## ðŸš€ Quick Demo

Want to see GitMind in action? Run the demo:

```bash
cd mvp
./test-demo.sh
```

This creates a complete demo repository with semantic links in an isolated Docker environment.

## Archive

### poc-2025-06-10
The original proof-of-concept created on June 10, 2025 that validated the core idea:
- Node.js server with Git integration
- D3.js visualization
- Chaos testing scripts
- Docker test environment

This POC proved that Git could function as a distributed knowledge graph and led to the current C implementation.

## Future Demos

Once the C implementation is fully distributed, this directory will contain:
- **quickstart/**: A 5-minute demo showing basic functionality
- **use-cases/**: Full demonstrations of each of the 10 use cases from the whitepaper
- **integrations/**: Examples of Gitmind integrated with popular tools
