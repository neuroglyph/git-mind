# License Decision Rationale: Why Apache 2.0 + Ethical Use

### TL;DR
We chose Apache 2.0 to maximize compatibility, adoption, and contribution—while protecting against patent trolls. To supplement it, we’ve added a public ethical use file and a project-wide humanist pledge.

### Why Not MIT?
MIT is dead simple, but it offers zero protection from patent litigation or unethical corporate behavior.

### Why Not GPL?
GPL ensures openness, but can discourage adoption in hybrid environments and is sometimes perceived as too restrictive. We’d rather invite adoption and lead by example.

### Why Apache 2.0?
- Business- and contributor-friendly
- Widely respected in professional circles
- Explicit patent protection
- Allows future flexibility (including dual-licensing if desired)

### Why the Ethical Use File?
Because licensing alone doesn’t communicate values. We want it to be clear: Gitmind is for augmenting human insight, not domination. We’re using our voice even if we can’t use force.

We believe ethics should live beside code.
