Let’s untangle the stack in plain English, then in architecture diagrams.

⸻

1. What you already proved in the demo

Layer	Demo implementation	Why it worked	What was only for the demo
Persistence	Git repos on disk	✔ Immutable, local, content-addressable	Nothing — Git is the store
Computation	git_graph_server.js (Node) shells out to git	✔ Quick to hack, cross-platform	Heavy use of exec(), loose error handling
Transport	Socket.IO (WebSocket)	✔ Instant bi-directional push to UI	Overkill if you just want local CLI
Presentation	D3.js single-page app	✔ Eye-catching, interactive	Not needed for headless/CLI use cases

So: the “server” was scaffolding for the visual demo, not a core requirement.

⸻

2. What the actual product needs

A. Core = gitmind CLI library
	•	Language: Go (fast & ships static) or Rust (libgit2)
	•	Responsibilities
	1.	Parse working repo for link objects (F001, etc.)
	2.	Emit queries (gitmind graph --json)
	3.	Create links (gitmind link A B)
	4.	Optional: run Chaos scripts

B. Optional Local Daemon (for UIs)
	•	Tiny HTTP/WebSocket bridge started by the CLI:

gitmind serve  # starts on :7420


	•	Reads same code-base; no database, still just Git.

C. Front-end(s)
	1.	D3 Browser UI – connects to the daemon when user wants visuals.
	2.	TUI / nCurses – quick link explorer for SSH / servers.
	3.	VS Code / Obsidian plug-ins – call CLI binary under the hood.

D. Transport Beyond Localhost
	•	Don’t invent a UDP protocol yet.
Git already syncs over SSH/HTTPS; your semantic objects ride inside packfiles.
	•	Longer-term: gossip layer (gRPC streaming or QUIC) for “live multi-user mesh,” but that’s Phase 3.

3. Road-map in bite-size milestones

Milestone	Deliverable	Stack pieces
MVP-CLI	gitmind binary • link • graph --json	Go/Rust, libgit2
Local UI	gitmind serve + D3 front-end	same binary + tiny HTTP wrapper
Chaos Mode	gitmind chaos --rate 5/s	spawn workers, still file-based
Plug-ins	VS Code extension calls gitmind graph	Node wrapper only
Mesh Alpha	Experimental gRPC relay between peers	optional daemon process

Notice: no external DB in any phase.

⸻

4. Why no database is still true
	•	Indexing: Git object IDs + in-memory cache per invocation (or boltDB/SQLite as on-disk cache, not source of truth).
	•	Querying: Graph operations run on the object set you just loaded; for huge repos you stream or build a lightweight index file.
	•	Sync: git push/pull already handles transport, compression, conflict resolution.

The “Node server + WebSocket” from the demo stays in the repo as /examples/web-ui/, clearly marked “optional viewer — not core.”

⸻

TL;DR vision
	1.	Single static CLI (Go/Rust) is the heart.
	2.	Daemon & WebSocket are add-ons for visuals.
	3.	No database introduced; Git + content-addressable links remain canonical.
	4.	Future real-time mesh = separate transport layer once core is rock solid.

Lock this contract first → start coding F001 in the CLI → everything else snaps on later.

Below are three quick architecture diagrams—all in Mermaid so you can paste them straight into GitHub, Obsidian, or any Mermaid-aware viewer.

1 ️⃣  Local-Machine Stack (Single-User)

flowchart TD
    subgraph User_Space
        CLI["gitmind CLI<br/>(Go/Rust binary)"] --> GitOps
        CLI -->|optional| Daemon["gitmind serve<br/>(tiny HTTP/WebSocket)"]
        Daemon --> WebUI["D3 Browser UI<br/>(localhost:7420)"]
        TUI["Terminal UI<br/>(ncurses)"] <-->|calls| CLI
    end

    subgraph FS["Local Filesystem"]
        GitRepo[".git object store<br/>(vault / projects / relationships)"]
    end

    GitOps["libgit2 / shell out"] --> GitRepo
    Daemon --> GitRepo

Key points:
	•	No external DB — all persistence is in the Git object store.
	•	The daemon is optional; it re-uses the same library code as the CLI.
	•	Any UI (browser, VS Code plug-in, etc.) just speaks HTTP/WebSocket to gitmind serve.

2 ️⃣  Semantic Link Creation Flow (F001)

sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant CLI as gitmind CLI
    participant Git as Local Git
    participant FS as File System

    User->>CLI: gitmind link note.md spec.md
    CLI->>Git: git hash-object note.md\n(generates SHA)
    CLI->>Git: git hash-object spec.md
    CLI->>FS: append "CROSS_REF: note.md -> spec.md" to link.md
    CLI->>Git: git add link.md
    CLI->>Git: git commit -m "link(F001): note -> spec"
    Git-->>CLI: commit SHA
    CLI-->>User: Success + link SHA

Result: two files are now semantically linked via an immutable F001 object stored as a normal Git blob and commit.

3 ️⃣  Distributed Mesh (Future Phase)

flowchart LR
    subgraph Peer A
        ACLI[gitmind CLI] --> AGit[(Git Repo)]
        AServe[gitmind serve] --> AGit
        AUI[D3 UI]
        AUI --> AServe
    end

    subgraph Peer B
        BCLI[gitmind CLI] --> BGit[(Git Repo)]
        BServe[gitmind serve] --> BGit
        BUI[D3 UI]
        BUI --> BServe
    end

    AServe <-->|gRPC stream / QUIC (Phase 3)| BServe
    AGit <-->|git push/pull (packfiles)| BGit

Notes:
	•	Code & data still sync via ordinary git push/pull.
	•	The live semantic stream (cross-repo link suggestions, chaos metrics) is a thin P2P layer (gRPC/QUIC) between optional daemons.
	•	If the daemons are off, repos stay compatible—only real-time hints disappear.
