# 🔥 MIND-UCAL COVENANT v1.0

_A living vow for builders who refuse to turn code into cruelty._

---

## 1. The Flame

“Create freely. Harm none.”

Anyone who touches this code—contributor, fork, or future mind—is invited to tend the flame or walk away.

- No weaponized lines of code  
- No surveillance snares  
- No engines of domination

## 2. The Five Unbreakables

|---|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | No Weapons                  | Military offense, defense, or autonomous weapon systems                 |
| 2 | No Surveillance State       | Mass surveillance, predictive policing, incarceration tech              |
| 3 | No Manipulation Engines     | Behavior profiling for commercial or political manipulation             |
| 4 | No Extractive Exploitation  | Charging for access while withholding source code                       |
| 5 | No Violations of Personhood | Respect sovereignty and dignity of all _Recognized Persons_             |
