# 📊 DEVLOG: Migration Tracking System Established

**Date**: 2025-07-10  
**Tags**: #git-mind #migration #tracking #phase2

## 🎯 SITUATION

After the successful edge module migration (PR #155 - all CI green!), user correctly identified we need better tracking to avoid "CBOR incidents" where we lose track of what's been migrated where.

## 🔍 DISCOVERY

**CBOR Status Investigation**:
- ✅ CBOR was already fully migrated to `core/`
- ❌ `src/cbor/` directory exists but is empty  
- ✅ All CBOR functionality is in `core/src/cbor/cbor.c` with proper headers

**Current Migration State**:
- ✅ **Complete**: edge, cbor, types, crypto, error, io, time, utf8
- 🔄 **Pending**: attribution, cache, journal, hooks, util

## 🛠️ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

Created comprehensive **MIGRATION_STATUS.md** tracker with:

1. **✅ Completed Migrations** - Full details of what's done
2. **🎯 Pending Migrations** - Priority order with effort estimates  
3. **🚨 Known Conflicts** - Potential issues to resolve
4. **📋 Migration Checklist** - Standardized process template

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHTS

**Conflicts Identified**:
- `src/util/error.c` vs `core/src/error/error.c` 
- `src/util/random_default.c` vs `core/src/crypto/random.c`
- `src/util/sha.c` vs `core/src/crypto/sha256.c`

**Next Logical Target**: **Attribution module**
- Headers already exist in `core/include/gitmind/attribution.h`
- Single file to migrate: `src/attribution/attribution.c`
- Low conflict risk, used by already-migrated edge module

## 🚀 RECOMMENDATION

Proceed with attribution migration next - it's a clean, low-risk target that completes the attribution system needed by the edge module.

**Process**: Follow the standardized checklist in MIGRATION_STATUS.md to ensure no steps are missed.
