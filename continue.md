  Continue Technical Debt Refactoring - Day 3: Constants Definition

  We've successfully completed Day 1-2 of the technical debt cleanup for git-mind:

  âœ… Day 1-2 COMPLETED:
  - Broke down all 4 monster functions (>100 lines) into focused functions <15 lines
  each
  - Implemented complete CLI output abstraction with --verbose/--porcelain support
  - All tests pass, output control is working perfectly

  CURRENT STATE: Ready to start Day 3 - Define all constants to eliminate magic values

  NEXT TASK: According to TECH_DEBT_TASKLIST.md Priority 3, we need to:

  1. Create Constants Headers:
    - include/gitmind/constants_cbor.h - CBOR type constants, size indicators, array
  sizes, field limits
    - include/gitmind/constants_internal.h - Buffer sizes, time conversions, Git
  constants, exit codes, file permissions
  2. Replace Magic Values across all modules:
    - Edge module - replace all magic numbers/strings
    - Journal module - replace all magic numbers/strings
    - Attribution module - replace all magic numbers/strings
    - CLI module - replace all magic numbers/strings
    - Cache module - replace all magic numbers/strings
    - Util module - replace all magic numbers/strings
    - Hooks module - replace all magic numbers/strings

  CONTEXT: This is part of improving the codebase score from 4.1/10 to 8+/10. We're
  following the 7-day technical debt cleanup plan before starting the Web UI milestone.

  FILES TO FOCUS ON: Look for hardcoded numbers like 65536, 13, 8, 20, 26, etc. and
  string literals that should be constants.

  Please continue with Day 3 tasks - creating the constants headers and systematically
  replacing magic values throughout the codebase.
