# Contributing to git-mind

Thank you for your interest in contributing to git-mind! This project aims to create a new medium for human-AI collaboration in understanding code.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the documentation**
   - [README.md](README.md) - Project overview
   - [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Development standards and practices
   - [TASKLIST.md](TASKLIST.md) - Current development status

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neuroglyph/git-mind
   cd git-mind
   make dev  # Opens Docker development shell
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   make test  # Runs all tests in Docker
   ```

## Development Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Write tests first
2. **SOLID Principles** - Keep code clean and maintainable
3. **KISS** - Simple solutions over complex ones
4. **YAGNI** - Don't add features until needed
5. **Dependency Injection** - For testability

## Code Standards

- **NO MAGIC NUMBERS** - Use #defined constants
- **NO MAGIC STRINGS** - Use #defined string constants
- **Silent by default** - Output only on error or with --verbose
- **Single Responsibility** - Each function does one thing
- **Always use Docker** - Never build on host

## Making Changes

1. **Check TASKLIST.md** for current priorities
2. **Create a feature branch**
3. **Write tests first** (TDD)
4. **Implement the feature**
5. **Update documentation**
6. **Run all tests**
7. **Submit a pull request**

## Attribution System

If you're an AI assistant helping with development:
- Set proper attribution when creating edges
- Use confidence scores appropriately
- Follow guidelines in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
