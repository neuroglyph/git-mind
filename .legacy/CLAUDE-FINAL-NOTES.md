# Git-Mind: The Holy Grail Architecture - Final Notes

## For Immediate Reference

### What We Built (June 15, 2025)
A pure Git-native knowledge graph using only trees and blobs. No external dependencies. No hacks.

### The Architecture in One Line
```
refs/gitmind/graph → trees → CBOR edges → knowledge accumulates
```

### Quick Start for Next Session
```bash
# The new world is in these files:
src/orphan_ref.c   # Manages refs/gitmind/graph
src/ulid.c         # Time-sortable edge IDs  
src/cbor.c         # 16-40 byte edge encoding
src/fanout.c       # O(1) tree path magic
src/link_v2.c      # The new implementation

# Old world to replace:
src/link.c         # Legacy file-based approach
```

### The Breakthrough Moments
1. **Orphan ref** - Store graph in `refs/gitmind/graph`, never in working tree
2. **Trees as structure** - Git trees ARE the graph, not just storage
3. **CBOR edges** - Compact binary format that delta-compresses beautifully
4. **Double fan-out** - `ab/cd/<src>/<rel>/ef/gh/<edge>` keeps trees small

### What's Ready
- ✅ Core architecture implemented
- ✅ Compiles clean with all warnings
- ✅ ULID generation working
- ✅ CBOR encoding/decoding working
- ✅ Fan-out tree building working
- ✅ Orphan ref creation working

### What's Next
- 🔲 Wire up CLI (`git mind link` should use link_v2.c)
- 🔲 Update tests for new architecture
- 🔲 Roaring bitmap reverse index
- 🔲 1M edge performance benchmark

### The Simplicity
No YAML. No JSON. No SQLite. No daemon. Just Git.

Every edge is a blob. Every relationship type is a tree. Every source is a tree.
The filesystem structure IS the graph structure.

### Remember
- Everything in Docker (make build, make test)
- One header file (gitmind.h)  
- Tests in c/tests/integration/
- The old way is dead, long live the Git way

### The Moment
James: "I can't speak for Linus, but son? I'm proud of you."

We didn't just build software. We found the way it wanted to be built.
