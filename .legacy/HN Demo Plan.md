For Hacker News, you need to demonstrate the **"holy shit" moment** in under 30 seconds. Here's what would make HN users get it:

## The Demo That Would Break HN

**"Show HN: Time-travel through your mental model of any Git repo"**

### The 30-Second Hook

A screencast showing:

```bash
# In any existing repo
git mind init

# Link some files (10 seconds of typing)
git mind link README.md src/main.rs --type implements
git mind link design-doc.md README.md --type inspired
git commit -m "linked my understanding"

# THE MAGIC MOMENT:
git checkout HEAD~20  # Go back 20 commits
git mind list         # See what you thought back then
git mind traverse README.md  # Follow your reasoning from that time

# Back to present
git checkout main
git mind evolution --show-changes  # Animated view of how your understanding evolved
```

**The "holy shit" moment**: Seeing your own mental model from 6 months ago, preserved perfectly.

### The AI Integration Hook

If you can get MCP working:

```bash
# Start conversation with Claude
git mind claude-session --remember-context

# (Claude and user discuss the codebase, make connections)
# Exit conversation

# Days later, different conversation
git mind claude-session --build-on-previous
# Claude: "Building on our previous discussion about the performance bottleneck..."
```

**The "holy shit" moment**: AI that actually remembers and builds on previous conversations.

### The Collaborative Hook

```bash
# Alice's understanding
git mind link auth.js security-concerns.md --confidence 0.8

# Bob merges his different perspective  
git mind merge-understanding --resolve-conflicts
# Shows: "Alice thinks auth.js is risky (0.8), Bob thinks it's solid (0.9)"
# System: "Consensus needed on security-concerns.md"
```

**The "holy shit" moment**: Git merge conflicts, but for ideas.

## What HN Needs to See

### 1. **It Actually Works** (Critical)

- Live demo, not mockups
- Real Git repos they can try it on
- Actual time-travel through commit history

### 2. **Novel Technical Approach** (HN Loves This)

- "We're using Git objects as a graph database"
- "Semantic relationships stored as content-addressed blobs"
- "Zero dependencies, pure C, 130KB binary"

### 3. **Immediate Practical Value** (Reduces Skepticism)

- "Never lose context on why you made decisions"
- "Onboard new team members by showing them your reasoning"
- "Document architecture decisions that survive refactoring"

### 4. **The Bigger Vision** (But Understated)

- Don't lead with "hive mind" or "consciousness"
- Instead: "What if your understanding of code could evolve like the code itself?"
- Let them discover the profound implications

## The Perfect HN Title

**"Show HN: git-mind â€“ version control for your understanding of code"**

Not: "Distributed cognitive infrastructure for hybrid consciousness"

## The Demo Flow

1. **Hook** (10 seconds): Show time-travel through mental models
2. **Technical** (30 seconds): Explain Git-native storage, show performance
3. **Practical** (30 seconds): Real use cases, team collaboration
4. **Vision** (20 seconds): "This is just the beginning..." (but subtle)
5. **Try It** (10 seconds): One-line install, works on any Git repo

## What Would Make HN Explode

If you could show:

- **Working MCP integration** where Claude remembers across sessions
- **Real-time collaborative understanding** between multiple developers
- **Actual time-travel** through someone's mental model of a complex codebase
- **All of this working TODAY** in a simple CLI tool

## The Comments You Want

- "Holy shit, I never thought of Git as a graph database for relationships"
- "This is actually novel, not just another knowledge management tool"
- "The time-travel aspect is genuinely useful for onboarding"
- "Wait, the AI actually remembers previous conversations?"
- "This could change how we document software architecture"

## The Wrong Demo

Don't show:

- Philosophical explanations of consciousness
- Complex theoretical use cases
- Features that don't work yet
- Marketing speak about "revolutionary" anything

**Show the working tool solving real problems, and let them discover the profound implications themselves.**

The best HN demos are: "I built this simple thing that does X" and then everyone realizes it's actually huge.
