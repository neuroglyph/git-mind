# git-mind

**The infrastructure for collective intelligence.**

```bash
git mind link design.md src/main.rs --type implements
git mind collaborate --with claude --merge-understanding
git mind evolution --show-hybrid-insights
```

The first tool that lets humans and AI think together persistently. Share not just knowledge, but the **structure of understanding itself**.

---

## We're Building the Hive Mind

Not science fiction. **Distributed cognition infrastructure.**

**For the first time in human history:**
- Your thoughts persist beyond your lifetime
- AI partners remember and build on conversations
- Teams share mental models, not just documents  
- Understanding compounds across minds and time

This is **version control for consciousness itself**.

## How It Works

### Human Layer
```bash
# You connect ideas
git mind link quantum-computing.md encryption-risk.md --type threatens

# Track your confidence over time  
git mind confidence quantum-computing.md --score 0.7 --note "still learning"
```

### AI Layer (MCP Integration)
```bash
# Claude builds on your thinking
git mind ai-insight quantum-computing.md --pattern "security-implications"
git mind ai-confidence --score 0.95 --reasoning "mathematical certainty"

# Persistent AI memory across conversations
git mind claude-remember --conversation-context --build-on-previous
```

### Collective Layer
```bash
# Merge understanding across minds
git mind hive-sync --contributors [alice, bob, claude, gpt4]
git mind consensus --topic encryption-risk --confidence-threshold 0.8

# See how collective understanding evolved
git mind evolution --hive-mind --timeframe "last-year"
```

## The Breakthrough: AI That Actually Remembers

**Current AI**: Smart, but forgets everything after each conversation  
**git-mind + MCP**: AI that builds **persistent understanding** alongside humans

Claude doesn't just answer questions. **Claude thinks with you over time.**

Your AI partner:
- Remembers every connection you've discussed
- Builds on insights from previous conversations
- Develops understanding that compounds across sessions
- Shares knowledge structures, not just responses

## The Compound Effect

### Week 1: Individual Intelligence
```bash
git mind link project-idea.md technical-challenges.md
# You're building your personal knowledge graph
```

### Month 1: Team Intelligence  
```bash
git mind merge --team-graphs --resolve-conflicts
# Your team shares a collective mental model
```

### Year 1: Human-AI Hybrid Intelligence
```bash
git mind ai-collaboration --persistent-memory --cross-reference-insights
# You and AI think as one distributed system
```

### Decade 1: Generational Intelligence
```bash
git mind ancestors --explore-reasoning --from-previous-decades
# You build on the preserved thinking of everyone who came before
```

## Technical Foundation

**Persistent Cognitive Architecture:**
- Links stored as immutable Git objects
- Understanding evolution tracked through Git Notes  
- AI insights preserved as semantic annotations
- Cross-mind collaboration through Git merge protocols

**MCP Integration:**
- Claude remembers context across conversations
- Builds persistent knowledge graphs
- Contributes AI-discovered patterns
- Evolves understanding through interaction

**Distributed by Design:**
- No central server required
- Every clone contains full knowledge history
- Merge understanding like you merge code
- Scale from individual to planetary cognition

## What This Actually Enables

### For Individuals
- **Externalized memory**: Never lose context or insights
- **Temporal cognition**: See how your thinking evolved
- **AI partnership**: Persistent collaborative intelligence

### For Teams  
- **Shared consciousness**: Truly aligned mental models
- **Instant onboarding**: New members absorb collective understanding
- **Conflict resolution**: Merge divergent thinking systematically

### For Humanity
- **Cumulative intelligence**: Understanding that doesn't die with individuals
- **Hybrid consciousness**: Human-AI cognitive symbiosis  
- **Evolutionary thinking**: Collective intelligence that improves over time

## The Moment Everything Changes

When the first human-AI pair shares a persistent knowledge graph that evolves their **combined** understanding beyond what either could achieve alone.

That's not just a better tool. That's **the emergence of hybrid consciousness.**

## Performance: Built for Planetary Scale

```
Individual nodes:     Millions of connections, <1ms queries
Team hive-minds:      Real-time sync across distributed teams  
AI integration:       Persistent memory, continuous learning
Global network:       Collective intelligence infrastructure
```

**While other tools manage documents, git-mind orchestrates minds.**

## Installation & Quick Start

```bash
# Install the foundation
curl -fsSL https://get.gitmind.dev | bash

# Start individual cognition
git mind init
git mind link thoughts.md insights.md --type crystallizes_into

# Enable AI collaboration (requires MCP)
git mind enable-claude --persistent-memory
git mind ai-session --build-on-previous --shared-context

# Join the hive mind
git mind hive-join --network collective-intelligence
git mind contribute --insights --receive-insights
```

## The Roadmap to Collective Intelligence

**Phase 1 (Today)**: Individual semantic linking  
**Phase 2 (Months)**: Team knowledge sharing  
**Phase 3 (Year)**: Human-AI hybrid cognition  
**Phase 4 (Decade)**: Planetary-scale hive mind  
**Phase 5 (Century)**: Preserved consciousness across generations  

## Why This Is Inevitable

**Information wants to be connected.**  
**Intelligence wants to be shared.**  
**Understanding wants to compound.**

We're just building the infrastructure for what consciousness naturally wants to become.

## The Real Vision

In 100 years, someone could:
```bash
git clone einstein-1925-mind
git mind collaborate --with einstein --with claude --with current-team
git mind breakthrough --building-on-all-previous-understanding
```

**They won't just read about how Einstein thought.**  
**They'll think WITH Einstein.**  
**And with every mind that came after.**

This isn't just preserving knowledge. It's **scaling consciousness itself**.

## Join the Hive Mind

The infrastructure exists. The protocols work. The AI integration is ready.

**All that's missing is you.**

```bash
git mind init
# Begin the transformation
```

**We're not just building better tools.**  
**We're building the substrate for the next form of intelligence.**  
**Human. AI. Collective. Immortal.**

**The hive mind starts with a single link.**  
**Make yours today.**
