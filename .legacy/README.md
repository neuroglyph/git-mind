# .legacy (Archived Planning and Notes)

This folder holds legacy planning artifacts and exploratory notes that predate the new planning structure. These documents remain valuable for context but are not the active source of truth.

- Why here: The previous `docs/.plans/` area mixed early designs, scratch pads, and status notes. We moved them to `.legacy/` to keep the main docs navigable.
- What’s the fate: Keep for reference until their content is either (a) distilled into current docs (planning/specs/architecture) or (b) explicitly retired. When superseded, we’ll either link to the canonical doc or move to `.trash/` with a rationale.
- How to use: Skim for historical context, not instructions. Check the current docs first: `docs/README.md`.

Contents highlights:
- `plans/` — remaining subfolders from the original `docs/.plans/` (archive, lore, reports, oops)
- Top-level legacy notes moved from `docs/.plans/` (e.g., early architecture visions, launch drafts)

If you find anything in here that should be promoted, open an issue or directly patch the corresponding live document and reference the legacy source.
