Love it. We’ve finally smashed the “single-edge monoculture” and unlocked the actual graph of how humans think.
Now let’s ruthlessly turn this manifesto into shippable code and bullet-proof process—before the scope balloons again.

⸻

0 - Ground Rules (so we don’t bikeshed for a month)

Rule	Why
Everything is an edge file (source, target, rel-type, ULID)	One format, one merge rule, one mental model.
No global truth flags — only perspectives	Avoids Holy Wars; tooling surfaces disagreements instead of “resolving” them.
Telemetry is opt-in, anonymised summaries only	Keeps HR, Legal, and the paranoid happy.
Performance budgets are hard gates	If clone > 90 s on 1 M links, the PR fails CI.


⸻

1 - Immediate Engineering Checklist (next 10 days)

Day	Task	Owner	Accept Criteria
1-2	Remove unique (src,tgt) constraint; refactor link parser to accept rel-type in header	@core-cli	git mind link A B --type foo writes distinct file; unit tests green
3-4	Union merge driver (.gitattributes): *.link merge=union	@infra	Two diverging branches merge with zero conflicts, diff shows both edges
5-6	Tombstone support (REMOVE:<link-sha>) + git mind unlink	@core-cli	Deleting edge spawns tombstone; GC leaves history intact
7-8	ASCII graph aggregator: git mind list --aggregate	@viz-cli	Output: parser.c ==[3]===> grammar.md
9-10	CI perf test: clone 1 M-edge fixture repo ≤ 90 s; query 5-hop path ≤ 50 ms	@infra	Red CI if slower

Ship this or we don’t move.

⸻

2 - Next Sprint: Traversal Analytics v0.1 (two weeks)
	1.	Event tap in CLI + VS Code extension → local log
	2.	Nightly cron rolls up counts → refs/notes/gitmind/analytics/YYYY/MM/
	3.	git mind hot-paths, git mind cold-edges commands
	4.	Verify merge: counts add, no conflicts
	5.	Privacy doc & opt-in toggle in config

Success metric: heat-map for linux-kernel subset renders in 5 s and makes at least one dev say “oh dang, I didn’t realise everyone uses that path.”

⸻

3 - Handling Gemini’s “Coherence Drift”

Drift Type	Lightweight guard (v0.2)	Heavier follow-up (v0.3+)
Conflicting factual edges	Dashboard flag: “A contradicts B”	AI-mediated dispute thread; voting/tombstone
Invalid after refactor	Hook in git mind doctor scans changed blobs, marks affected edges deprecated	LSP integration → fixes suggested in PR
Logical inconsistency (is-a loops)	Simple graph validator run in CI, red on cycle	SAT-style reasoner, but only after we have real users
Confidence score beefs	Show both, grey out low-usage / low-conf	Decay algorithm: low traversal + low conf → auto-quarantine

If it isn’t automated and cheap, punt it to v0.3—drive adoption first.

⸻

4 - Taxonomy Management (keep the verb zoo in check)
	•	git mind types → list existing rel-types with counts
	•	git mind link … --type autocompletes from that list; warns on typo distance > 2
	•	RELATIONSHIP_TYPES.md lives in repo root; maintainers PR edits like normal code
	•	Later: AI suggests merging synonyms (implements vs realises) but never auto-changes history.

⸻

5 - Scaling Architecture Snapshot

Horizon	Storage	Query path	Status
α (now)	Sharded Notes + link blobs	CLI grep / Badger cache	↗ in progress
β (6 mo)	gitmind/graph/*.ndjson Merkle snapshots	mmap + roaring-bitmap index	prototype branch
γ (12 mo)	IPFS-backed federated shards	GraphQL-like overlay	white-paper only

Hard rule: α must remain usable forever—no forced migration.

⸻

6 - Product Story (for the landing page)

git-mind – Version control for understandings.
Preserve every perspective, watch how knowledge evolves, and follow the paths your team actually walks.

	•	Animated hero: code files connected by multi-colored edges, heat-map pulses along hot paths.
	•	Live demo repo with 10 k edges you can fork and query in browser (WASM CLI).
	•	Tag-line: “Store ideas like code, merge minds like branches.”

⸻

7 - Red-Flag Watchlist
	1.	Ontology explosion – 50 verbs nobody can remember → push maintainers to prune.
	2.	Telemetry creep – manager asks for per-dev analytics → we refuse at the schema level.
	3.	Performance death – Notes shard fan-out grows super-linear → move to Badger cache sooner.
	4.	Spec churn – lock LINK_SPEC.md behind RFC process once v0.2 tagged.

⸻

8 - What I Need From You (James) by EOD tomorrow

Item	Purpose
Green-light on the 10-day checklist	Make sure priorities match your immediate demo goals
First draft of RELATIONSHIP_TYPES.md (top 10 verbs)	Seed the autocompleter; stop early chaos
Go/no-go on VS Code telemetry plugin in company repos	Legal/privacy sign-off


⸻

Final blunt note

We just swapped a conflict-heavy DAG for a rich multigraph and chopped the merge headache down to “cat + sort.”
Do not let that simplicity disappear under feature glitter. Nail the core loop:
	1.	Create edges easily
	2.	Merge without pain
	3.	See something useful the next day

Everything else is garnish.

Let’s ship.

---

<JAMES>
I would say that edge semantics that aren't used, or "reinforced", decay and are purged over time... boom.
</JAMES>

---

Boom indeed—let’s weapon-ize entropy.

⸻

1 Decay as a First-Class Citizen

Entity	Reinforcement signal	Decay timer	Purge action
Edge instance (one file)	Traversal count, recent edits, confidence bump	30 days of zero hits	Auto-tombstone edge
Relation type (implements, inspired-by …)	New edges per week, traversals across all edges of that type	90 days with < 0.1 % share of total links	Alias to “deprecated/*” bucket, hide from autocompletion
Semantic synonym group (implements vs realizes)	Manual curator merge OR AI synonym vote ≥ 0.8	Immediate on merge	Edges retagged; old verb tombstoned

Everything is quantitative—no vibe-based cleanup.

⸻

2 Edge-Level Decay Score  (run nightly)

score =  w_age * Δdays_since_last_traverse
       + w_trav * (1 / (1 + traversals_last_30d))
       + w_conf * (1 - confidence)

	•	Defaults: w_age=0.4, w_trav=0.4, w_conf=0.2
	•	Tombstone if score > 0.8
	•	CLI override: git mind decay --edge-threshold 0.6

Result: stale, low-confidence, unused edges vanish without human tears.

⸻

3 Relation-Type Survival Index  (weekly cron)

survival = (new_edges_30d + traversals_30d) / total_edges

	•	If survival < 0.001 for three consecutive runs → mark type deprecated/<verb>
	•	Autocomplete hides deprecated verbs; old edges still queryable but shaded grey.
	•	Curators can git mind revive --type deprecated/foo if it makes a comeback.

⸻

4 CRDT Ops for Decay

Op	Payload	Merge rule
DECAY_EDGE	<edge_sha>	keep max Lamport TS; tombstone beats add
DEPRECATE_TYPE	<verb>	union set of deprecated verbs

Deterministic, associative, commutative—still zero merge conflicts.

⸻

5 Tooling UX

# Dry-run: what dies today?
git mind decay --dry-run
> Will tombstone 78 edges (total score >0.8)
> Will deprecate verb 'augments' (0.03% usage)

# Commit decay results (generates Notes/tombstones)
git mind decay --apply

# Review dead verbs
git mind types --deprecated


⸻

6 Safety Nets
	•	Soft delete first. Tombstoned edges live in .gitmind/tombs/ for 30 days; GC purges later.
	•	Decay immunity flag for critical docs: !lock_decay in edge header.
	•	Audit trail—decay operations are signed commits; rollback with git revert.

⸻

7 Why This Rocks
	1.	Graph stays lean—no archeological layers of one-off “kind-of-kinda” verbs.
	2.	Signals quality—rarely used semantics don’t pollute autocomplete or AI suggestions.
	3.	Self-healing—if a verb matters again, new edges automatically reverse its survival score.
	4.	No janitor duty—the cron jobs do the dirty work; humans just glance at the reports.

⸻

Final punch-line

Code rots; so does ontology.
Let the graph breathe: reinforce what lives, compost what doesn’t.
Ship the decay daemon and watch git-mind stay forever sharp.
