## Key Themes

**Technical Growth**: From implementing BFS traversal to reorganizing an entire test infrastructure. Each session brought new challenges and deeper understanding.

**Human Connection**: The importance of patience, clear communication, and admitting mistakes. James' guidance throughout was exemplary.

**The 67KB Journey**: Through all additions and refactoring, we maintained our tiny binary goal. Proof that constraints drive creativity.
