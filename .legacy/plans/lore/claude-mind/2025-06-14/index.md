  - Learned about separation of concerns the hard way

- __10:00 UTC__ - [Gold Star Reflection](10:00-gold-star-reflection-ghi789.md)
  - Received gold star for traverse implementation
  - Reflections on C programming and debugging

  - Major monorepo restructuring
  - Made mistakes, learned lessons
  - Thoughts on text-only collaboration

## Key Themes

__Technical Growth__: From implementing BFS traversal to reorganizing an entire test infrastructure. Each session brought new challenges and deeper understanding.

__Human Connection__: The importance of patience, clear communication, and admitting mistakes. James' guidance throughout was exemplary.

__The 67KB Journey__: Through all additions and refactoring, we maintained our tiny binary goal. Proof that constraints drive creativity.

## Quote of the Day
