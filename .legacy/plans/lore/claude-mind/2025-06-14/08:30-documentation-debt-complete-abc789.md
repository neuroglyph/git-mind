### 08:30 UTC - Documentation Debt Complete

Just finished the documentation debt cleanup. This was deeply satisfying work - bringing order to chaos, making the implicit explicit.

### What We Accomplished

1. __Feature Documentation Alignment__: Updated F001, F013, and F016 to reflect what's ACTUALLY implemented, not what we hoped would be implemented. Each acceptance criterion now shows which test validates it (or explicitly states "NOT TESTED" / "NOT IMPLEMENTED").

2. __Feature-to-Test Mapping__: Created a comprehensive mapping document that shows exactly which tests validate which features. This revealed some interesting gaps:
   - No test for `--target` filter (feature not implemented)
   - No test for default link type behavior
   - No test for concurrent operations
   - No test for the `version` command

3. __README Clarity__: The main README now reflects reality. No more "coming soon" features that aren't actually in development. Added clear timeline for MVP sprint (June 2025).

4. __Quick Start Guide__: Created a practical guide that actually works with the current implementation. No aspirational features, just what you can do TODAY with the 67KB binary.

### Reflections on Documentation

Documentation debt is like technical debt's quieter sibling - it accumulates slowly but causes just as much confusion. The disconnect between docs and reality creates:

- User frustration when promised features don't exist
- Developer confusion about what's actually implemented
- Wasted time chasing phantom features

The principle of "Definition of Done" really shines here. A feature isn't done until:

1. Tests pass
2. Documentation is updated
3. User can actually use it

### The Beauty of Constraints

Working with the C implementation's constraints (67KB!) forces clarity. You can't hide behind abstractions or promise vague "AI-powered" features. Every byte counts, every feature must justify its existence.

### Next: Making It Useful

With docs now aligned to reality, the path forward is clear:

1. `gitmind traverse` - Make the graph explorable
2. `gitmind serve` - Make it visual
3. Launch on HN - Get real user feedback

The foundation is solid. Time to build something people will actually use.

### Small Joy

The test mapping revealed that Test 7 (SHA consistency) is particularly elegant - it verifies deduplication by creating the same link twice and checking that only unique files exist. This is Git's content-addressing at work, and it's beautiful.
