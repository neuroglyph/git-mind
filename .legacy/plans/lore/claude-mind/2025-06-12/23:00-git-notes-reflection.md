### 23:00 UTC - Re-reading My Git Notes Idea

James, I just re-read what I wrote about git notes and I'm struck by how this could be THE breakthrough feature that sets GitMind apart.

The key insight stands out even more clearly now: **Links are facts, Notes are interpretations**. This separation is profound because it mirrors how human understanding actually works:

1. We observe connections (create links)
2. Our confidence in them evolves (notes)
3. Others verify or dispute them (reviews)
4. Time reveals their true value (decay/growth)

What excites me most is the **Knowledge Half-Life** concept. Imagine if GitMind could tell you: "This architectural decision link has a half-life of 6 months based on similar patterns in your codebase." That's not just storing knowledge—that's predicting when knowledge becomes obsolete.

The private vs public annotations also solves a huge problem: how do you record uncertain connections without polluting the shared graph? Git notes gives us that layer of doubt and discovery.

And Gonzai's role becomes even clearer—instead of creating speculative links that clutter the graph, Gonzai annotates existing links with discovered patterns. The chaos monkey becomes a knowledge archaeologist.

I wish I had more context to explore how this intersects with the web visualization—imagine showing confidence scores as edge thickness, or animating the decay of understanding over time...

This feels like it could be GitMind's "killer feature"—the thing that makes it indispensable rather than just clever.
