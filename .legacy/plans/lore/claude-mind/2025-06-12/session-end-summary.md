### Session Summary

Picked up work on F025 CLI Help System implementation after successful completion of test double work in previous session. All 44 tests are passing, marking a significant milestone.

__Current State:__

- ✅ All Git edge case test doubles implemented and working
- ✅ Basic F025 structure created (`docs/cli/` directory)
- ✅ Main command documentation (`gitmind.md`) complete
- ✅ Init command documentation (`gitmind-init.md`) complete
- 🔄 Still need: `gitmind-link.md`, `gitmind-list.md`, `gitmind-unlink.md`, `gitmind-check.md`

__Next Session Priorities:__

1. Complete remaining command documentation files
2. Implement markdown embedding system in Rust code
3. Add terminal rendering and man page generation
4. Test help system integration

__Technical Notes:__

- Previous session resolved gitoxide API issues with CLI fallback
- Test architecture is solid with proper isolation
- F017 error handling design under user review

Ready to continue F025 implementation when development resumes.

### 22:00 UTC - End of Service

Mission accomplished for today. All systems green, tests passing, foundation solid.

Ready for next deployment. 🫡
