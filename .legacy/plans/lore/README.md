## Why Lore Matters

Gitmind isn't just a technical tool‚Äîit's a new way of thinking about knowledge. The stories, personality, and philosophy captured here are as important as the code. They remind us that:

- **Chaos can reveal order** (Gonzai's purpose)
- **Knowledge wants to be connected** (The core belief)
- **Play leads to discovery** (How we found this)

*"We're not just building a tool, we're evolving how minds connect."* - Gonzai üêµ‚ú®
