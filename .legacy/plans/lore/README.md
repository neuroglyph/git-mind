## Why Lore Matters

Gitmind isn't just a technical tool‚Äîit's a new way of thinking about knowledge. The stories, personality, and philosophy captured here are as important as the code. They remind us that:

- __Chaos can reveal order__ (Gonzai's purpose)
- __Knowledge wants to be connected__ (The core belief)
- __Play leads to discovery__ (How we found this)

_"We're not just building a tool, we're evolving how minds connect."_ - Gonzai üêµ‚ú®
