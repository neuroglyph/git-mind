Ah shit, you need the __actual post template__. Let me give you the exact HN format:

---

## The HN Post Structure

### __Title__ (This is critical - most important 8 words you'll write)

```
Show HN: git-mind – time-travel through your mental model of any Git repo
```

__Why this works:__

- "Show HN" signals working demo
- "time-travel" is the hook - nobody else does this
- "mental model" is relatable but intriguing
- "any Git repo" shows broad applicability

__Alternative titles:__

- `Show HN: git-mind – version control for your understanding of code`
- `Show HN: git-mind – see how your thinking about a codebase evolved over time`

### __The Link__

Post the GitHub repo URL: `https://github.com/neuroglyph/neuroglyph`

### __Your Launch Comment__ (Post this immediately after submitting)

```
Hey HN! I built git-mind because I kept losing context on why I made certain architectural decisions in my codebases. Six months later, I'd look at code and think "why did I connect these files?" but the reasoning was gone.

git-mind stores semantic relationships directly in your Git repo:

    git mind link design.md src/main.rs --type implements
    git mind link README.md docs/api.md --type references

The interesting part isn't the linking - it's that these relationships are versioned. You can literally checkout an old commit and see what you thought the codebase structure was at that point in time:

    git checkout HEAD~20
    git mind list  # Shows your mental model from 20 commits ago

I'm calling it "time-travel through your mental model" because that's what it feels like when you explore how your understanding of a project evolved.

Technical details:
- Pure C, 130KB binary, <1ms startup
- Stores links as content-addressed Git objects
- Zero dependencies beyond Git itself
- Works on any existing Git repo

Early prototype, lots of rough edges, but the core concept seems to work. Would love feedback on whether this scratches an itch for anyone else.

Try it: curl -fsSL https://get.gitmind.dev | bash

### __Why This Comment Works:__

1. __Personal story__ - You had a real problem
2. __Simple demo__ - Shows exact commands
3. __Clear value prop__ - Time-travel through understanding
4. __Technical credibility__ - Real numbers, no fluff
5. __Humble tone__ - "early prototype, rough edges"
6. __Call to action__ - Easy install, demo repo

### __What NOT to Post:__

```
❌ "Revolutionary infrastructure for distributed cognition"
❌ "Finally solved knowledge management"
❌ "Game-changing paradigm shift"
❌ Long philosophical explanations
❌ Comparisons to other tools
❌ Roadmap/future features
```

### __Follow-up Strategy:__

__Hour 1-2:__ Reply to every comment, even critical ones __Hour 3-6:__ Share interesting technical insights from good questions __Hour 6-24:__ Thank people who tried it, address any issues

### __Sample Responses to Common Comments:__

__"This is just file linking"__

> "Yeah, the linking itself is simple. The novel part is that it's versioned - you can see how your understanding evolved alongside your code. The demo repo shows this better than I can explain it."

__"Why not just use comments/docs?"__

> "Good point. Comments are great for explaining individual decisions. This is more about tracking relationships between files/concepts that change over time. But you're right that good documentation is probably more important than this tool."

__"Interesting, but not sure I'd use it"__

> "Fair! It definitely scratches a specific itch. If you work on complex codebases with lots of context that changes over time, it might be useful. If not, probably not worth the overhead."

## __The Secret Sauce__

__Be genuinely curious about whether people find this useful.__ Don't sell it. Don't defend it. Just: "I built this thing, it works for me, wondering if it works for anyone else."

That authenticity is what makes HN posts successful.
