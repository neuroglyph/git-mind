# Documentation Debt Resolution Summary

**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Author:** Claude  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## What We Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Consolidated Task Lists
- **Before:** 3 confusing files (TASKLIST.md, TASKLIST_backup.md, TASKLIST-MVP-FOCUSED.md)
- **After:** Single TASKLIST.md with:
  - Current milestone (MVP for HN)
  - Future milestones with timeline
  - Backlog for unscheduled items
  - Visual Gantt chart and dependency graph
  - Clear success metrics

### 2. ‚úÖ Updated Feature Documentation
- **F001 (Git Storage):** Changed from "In Progress" to "Implemented"
- **F013 (CLI Tools):** Changed from "In Progress" to "Implemented" 
- **F016 (Link Hygiene):** Changed from "Proposed" to "Implemented"
- All three moved to `design/features/completed/` directory

### 3. ‚úÖ Created New Documentation
- **Feature Completion SITREP:** Comprehensive audit of claimed vs actual status
- **Feature-to-Test Mapping:** Documents which tests validate which features
- **Completed Features README:** Summary of what's done in Phase 1a

### 4. ‚úÖ Updated User-Facing Docs
- **README.md:** Now reflects actual working commands, not future vision
- **docs/README.md:** Reorganized to show completed vs in-progress features

### 5. ‚úÖ Removed Cruft
- Deleted empty `testdata/` directory
- Removed duplicate task list files

## Key Insights Uncovered

### The 70% Problem
- Implementation: ~100% complete for MVP
- Documentation: ~30% updated
- Result: Confusion about what actually works

### The Real MVP Status
| Component | Status |
|-----------|---------|
| Core CLI | ‚úÖ Complete (7 commands) |
| Tests | ‚úÖ Complete (11 tests) |
| Binary | ‚úÖ 67KB achieved |
| Docker | ‚úÖ Working |
| **Usefulness** | ‚ùå Missing traversal & visualization |

### What Makes It HN-Worthy
Current state: "Cool 67KB binary that stores links"  
Needed state: "I can explore and visualize my codebase connections"

Missing pieces:
1. `gitmind traverse` - Explore beyond direct links
2. `gitmind serve` - See the graph visually

## Next Actions (From Updated TASKLIST)

### Today (June 14)
- [x] Documentation debt cleanup ‚úÖ DONE!

### This Weekend (June 15-16)
- [ ] Implement `gitmind traverse` command
- [ ] Implement `gitmind serve` + basic web UI

### Next Week (June 17-24)
- [ ] Polish demo repository
- [ ] Create cross-platform binaries
- [ ] Prepare launch materials

### Launch (June 25)
- [ ] Submit to Hacker News! üöÄ

## Summary

We've successfully:
1. Consolidated 3 task lists ‚Üí 1 organized roadmap
2. Updated 3 feature docs to reflect reality
3. Created 3 new audit/mapping documents
4. Fixed user-facing documentation
5. Established clear path to HN launch

**Documentation debt: RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

The path is now clear: Add traversal + visualization = ship to HN!
