# Feature Completion Status SITREP

**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Author:** Claude  
**Purpose:** Audit feature completion status against Definition of Done

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding:** Phase 1a is marked as "COMPLETE" in TASKLIST.md, but the underlying feature specifications show otherwise. This is a documentation/tracking disconnect that needs immediate attention.

## Definition of Done (Per CLAUDE.md)

A feature is only complete when:
1. All acceptance criteria from `design/features/F*.md` have corresponding tests
2. Tests pass at all three levels (unit, integration, end-to-end)  
3. User story is demonstrable through end-to-end tests
4. Documentation is updated
5. Code follows project conventions

## Feature Audit Results

### F001: Git Object Storage
- **TASKLIST Status:** ✅ Complete (Phase 1a)
- **Feature Doc Status:** "In Progress"
- **Implementation Progress:** 2/5 items checked
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 0/15 items checked ❌
- **Tests:** Basic functionality tested in test.sh
- **Verdict:** NOT COMPLETE per Definition of Done

### F013: CLI Tools  
- **TASKLIST Status:** ✅ Complete (Phase 1a)
- **Feature Doc Status:** "In Progress"
- **Implementation Progress:** 5/6 items checked
- **Acceptance Criteria:** No formal criteria defined ❌
- **Tests:** Commands tested in test.sh
- **Verdict:** NOT COMPLETE (no acceptance criteria to validate against)

### F016: Link Hygiene
- **TASKLIST Status:** ✅ Complete (Phase 1a)
- **Feature Doc Status:** "Proposed" (not even started!)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 0/13 items checked ❌
- **Tests:** `unlink` and `check` commands ARE tested
- **Verdict:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE (implementation exists but spec not updated)

### F017: Error Handling Improvements
- **TASKLIST Status:** Listed in Phase 1a
- **Feature Doc Status:** Not audited (but timeline shows "active")
- **Tests:** Unknown
- **Verdict:** AUDIT NEEDED

### F025: CLI Help System
- **TASKLIST Status:** Listed as "✨ NEW" in roadmap
- **Feature Doc Status:** "ACCEPTED" (not implemented)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 0/31 items checked ❌
- **Tests:** None
- **Verdict:** NOT COMPLETE (correctly marked as not done)

### F026-F030: Graph Query Features
- **TASKLIST Status:** Not mentioned (!!)
- **Feature Doc Status:** "Planned" with full specs
- **Tests:** None
- **Verdict:** CORRECTLY MARKED as not complete

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Documentation Disconnect
The C implementation was completed rapidly (June 13, 2025) and achieved impressive results (67KB binary), but the feature documentation was never updated to reflect:
- What was actually implemented
- Which acceptance criteria were met
- What remains to be done

### 2. Missing Acceptance Criteria Validation
`test.sh` contains 11 tests that validate functionality, but these tests are not mapped to acceptance criteria. We have:
- Tests that prove the code works
- Specs that define what "working" means
- No connection between the two

### 3. Feature Tracking Confusion  
- TASKLIST.md tracks implementation tasks
- Feature docs track acceptance criteria
- These are not synchronized

### 4. New Features Not in TASKLIST
F026-F030 (graph query features) exist with detailed specs but aren't mentioned in TASKLIST.md at all.

## Evidence of Actual Completion

The C implementation IS functionally complete for basic operations:
- ✅ All 7 commands implemented (init, link, list, unlink, check, status, version)
- ✅ 11 integration tests passing
- ✅ 67KB binary achieved
- ✅ Docker-based testing working
- ✅ Memory-safe implementation

### What test.sh Actually Validates

1. **gitmind init** - Creates `.gitmind/links/` directory
2. **gitmind link** - Creates link files with SHA-based names
3. **gitmind list** - Shows all links, filters by source
4. **gitmind unlink** - Removes specific links
5. **SHA deduplication** - Same link content = same file
6. **Git integration** - Links can be committed
7. **gitmind status** - Shows link count statistics
8. **gitmind check** - Detects broken links
9. **gitmind check --fix** - Removes broken links

This covers the core MVP functionality, but doesn't validate all the acceptance criteria in the feature specs.

## Summary: Claimed vs Actual Completion

### Phase 1a MVP Status
- **Claimed:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Actual:** ~70% complete (functional but not validated against specs)

### By Feature:
| Feature | Claimed | Actual | Gap |
|---------|---------|--------|-----|
| F001 Git Storage | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Works but 0/15 criteria checked | Documentation |
| F013 CLI Tools | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Works but no criteria defined | Specification |
| F016 Link Hygiene | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Works but marked "Proposed" | Documentation |
| F017 Error Handling | In Progress | ❓ Unknown | Needs audit |
| F025 Help System | ✨ New | ❌ Not started (0/31 criteria) | Correct |
| F026-F030 Query | Not listed | ❌ Designed only | Correct |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Update Feature Docs** - Mark F001, F013, F016 acceptance criteria that ARE met based on test.sh
2. **Create Acceptance Test Mapping** - Document which tests validate which criteria
3. **Update Feature Statuses** - Change from "In Progress"/"Proposed" to accurate status
4. **Add F026-F030 to TASKLIST** - These are designed but not tracked

### Process Improvements

1. **Single Source of Truth** - Either TASKLIST or Feature docs should be primary
2. **Definition of Done Checklist** - Create explicit checklist per feature
3. **Test Traceability** - Each test should reference what it validates

## Conclusion

The implementation is more complete than the documentation suggests, but we cannot claim features are "DONE" without:
1. Updated acceptance criteria checkboxes
2. Clear mapping of tests to criteria
3. Accurate status in feature documents

**The 67KB C binary works great, but our paperwork needs catching up!**

*Note: This is a documentation/process issue, not a code quality issue. The implementation appears solid.*
