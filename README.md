# git-mind üß†

> **‚ö†Ô∏è MAJOR REWRITE IN PROGRESS**: This project is undergoing a complete architectural overhaul to fix 11,951 code quality warnings and establish proper foundations. Not production-ready. See [The Great Migration](#the-great-migration) below.

## What is git-mind?

A Git-native tool for versioning your understanding of code, not just the code itself.

```bash
# Create semantic links between files
git mind link design.md src/main.rs --type implements

# Time-travel through your mental model
git checkout HEAD~10
git mind list  # See what connections you understood 10 commits ago
```

**The key insight**: Your understanding of how code connects evolves over time. git-mind makes that evolution visible and queryable.

## Why?

You know that `UserService.java` implements the design in `user-flows.md`. Six months later, that connection is lost. New team members can't find the relationships. The context dies with time.

git-mind stores these relationships as Git objects, giving them the same permanence and version history as your code.

## üöß The Great Migration

**Current Status**: Rebuilding from the ground up

We discovered 11,951 code quality warnings in our codebase. Rather than patch them incrementally, we're doing a complete architectural rebuild to get it right:

- **Phase 1** (Current): Building solid foundations in `core/`
  - Error handling with Result types
  - Strong typedefs for domain concepts  
  - Security primitives from day one
  - Zero warnings policy on all new code

- **Phase 2**: Migrate existing functionality
  - Reimplement each module using new foundations
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Delete legacy code as we go

- **Phase 3**: New features on solid base
  - Web UI with graph visualization
  - AI collaboration features
  - Cross-repository relationships

See [docs/enforcer/ROADMAP_TO_REFACTORING.md](docs/enforcer/ROADMAP_TO_REFACTORING.md) for the full plan.

## Current State

### What Works ‚úÖ
- Basic CLI commands (link, list, traverse)
- Git-native storage
- Time-travel through git checkout
- Tests pass (on legacy code)

### What's Broken üî•
- 11,951 compiler warnings
- No proper error handling
- Memory management issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code quality violations everywhere

### What We're Building üèóÔ∏è
- Clean modular architecture
- Proper error handling (Result types)
- Memory-safe operations
- Security-first design
- Zero warnings on all code

## For Developers

If you want to help or just watch the migration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuroglyph/git-mind
cd git-mind

# Everything runs in Docker
make build   # Builds the legacy version (with warnings)
make test    # Tests pass despite the warnings

# Don't touch src/ - it's quarantined
# New development happens in core/
```

**Important**: 
- The pre-commit hook blocks changes to `src/` (legacy code)
- All new development happens in `core/` with zero warnings
- We're following "touch it = rewrite it completely" rule

## The Vision (Unchanged)

git-mind will become infrastructure for versioning understanding:

- **For individuals**: Never lose context on why code connects
- **For teams**: Share mental models that evolve with code
- **For AI**: Collaborate on building knowledge graphs
- **For the future**: Make understanding as permanent as code

## Timeline

- **Now - Week 4**: Build foundations (error handling, types, security)
- **Week 5-8**: Migrate core functionality with zero warnings
- **Week 9+**: New features on solid foundation
- **Target**: Production-ready by Q2 2025

## Contributing

Want to help? We need:
- C developers who care about code quality
- Feedback on the architecture
- Ideas for the future

But please understand: we're in heavy construction mode. Things will break and change rapidly.

**Bottom line**: git-mind is a tool for versioning your understanding of code. We're rebuilding it properly. Come back in a few months for the good stuff, or join us in fixing 11,951 warnings. üî•
