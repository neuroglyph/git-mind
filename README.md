> **Version your thoughts. Branch your ideas. Merge understanding.**

`git-mind` transforms any Git repository into a **serverless knowledge graph**, where relationships evolve with your history and AI helps uncover hidden connections.

**No servers. No setup. Just `git push` your mind.**

## 🌟 What You Can Do

### Navigate Your Codebase by Meaning

```bash
# "What implements our authentication?"
$ git mind query --implements "auth-flow.md"
src/auth.c          (verified, 2 days ago)
tests/auth.test.js  (verified, 2 days ago)
src/oauth.c         (AI suggested, 1 hour ago)

# See how your understanding evolved
$ git checkout main~30
$ git mind query --implements "auth-flow.md"
basic_auth.c        (30 days ago)

$ git checkout main
$ git mind query --implements "auth-flow.md"
oauth2.c
jwt_handler.c
basic_auth.c
# Your knowledge graph evolved with your code!
````

### Build a Living Knowledge Base

```bash
# Connect ideas as you write
$ git mind link notes/quantum.md papers/bell-1964.pdf --type cites
$ git mind link notes/quantum.md notes/entanglement.md --type explores

# Discover thought patterns
$ git mind query "ideas without connections"
notes/orphaned-thought.md (created 3 weeks ago)
notes/random-insight.md (created 1 month ago)
```

### Collaborate Through Forks & Merges

```bash
# Fork someone's knowledge graph
$ git clone https://github.com/alice/research.git
$ git mind explore --author alice
423 concepts, 1,247 connections

# Merge understanding
$ git merge bob/authentication-redesign
Merging 47 new semantic edges...
3 conflicts in knowledge graph (view with: git mind conflicts)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install/build instructions: see `docs/install.md`.

CLI examples (subset implemented today):

```bash
# Start linking
git mind link README.md src/main.c --type documents
git mind link src/auth.c tests/auth.test.js --type "tested-by"

# Explore connections
git mind list --from src/auth.c

# Rebuild cache when needed
git mind cache-rebuild
```

Package managers (Homebrew/Winget): coming soon.

👉 For a hands-on walkthrough, see `docs/tutorial.md`.

## ✨ The Magic

- **Your repo is the database** — No servers, no external dependencies
- **Time-travel built in** — Check out any commit, get the graph from that moment
- **AI copilot ready** — Let AI suggest connections, you review and merge
- **Branch and merge ideas** — Try wild connections in a branch, merge what works

---

## 🔮 Real-World Uses

**Software Architecture**

- Trace decisions through code
- See which tests cover which requirements
- Understand impact before refactoring

**Research & Writing**

- Build Zettelkasten-style note networks
- Track citation graphs
- Fork and extend others' research

**Team Knowledge**

- Onboard developers with explorable codebases
- Preserve institutional memory in the repo
- Share mental models through PRs

## 🤖 Human + AI Co-Thought

git-mind treats AI as a collaborator with clear attribution:

```bash
# AI suggests connections in a branch
$ git checkout -b ai/suggestions
$ git mind ai discover
Found 23 potential connections...

# You review and cherry-pick
$ git mind review --source ai
src/cache.c implements docs/caching-strategy.md (confidence: 0.92)
[Accept/Reject/Skip]? a

# Clear attribution preserved
$ git mind list --from src/cache.c --format json
{
"to": "docs/caching-strategy.md",
"type": "implements",
"author": "ai-assistant",
"verified_by": "james",
"timestamp": "2024-11-08T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## HISTORY

`git-mind` emerged from a simple observation:  we spend enormous effort understanding code, then throw that understanding away.  

What if we could capture it?

The journey from idea to implementation taught us:

- Simple is powerful (just Git commits)
- Performance enables adoption (Roaring Bitmaps)
- Evolution is inevitable (AUGMENTS system)
- Understanding is the real product

### AUTHORS

Created by J. Kirby Ross and the Neuroglyph Collective.  

*"Hakuna Matata"* — no worries, your semantic connections are safe.

### THE PROMISE

*"Remember who you are."*

Your code tells a story. `git-mind` helps you remember it, share it, and build upon it.  

In the great Circle of Development, no understanding is lost, no connection forgotten, no wisdom wasted.

---

## EPILOGUE

It was 3 AM. I had just finished implementing **Roaring Bitmaps**,  and in my exhausted haze the wildebeest stampede from *The Lion King*  suddenly snapped into place as the perfect metaphor.  

That moment of delirium became a spark. For a while, many of the `git-mind`  docs had “Circle of Life” editions — Mufasa and Rafiki explaining caches,  hooks, and semantic edges.  Those playful docs are gone now, (well, not really, they're in the git history...),but the spirit remains.  

Because sometimes **art makes itself.**

---

*"Oh yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it."*

**Choose to learn. Choose `git-mind`.**
