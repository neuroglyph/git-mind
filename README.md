# `git-mind` 🧠

_A Git-integrated knowledge graph for tracking relationships between code artifacts._

__🚧 MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL MIGRATION IN PROGRESS 🏗️__

We’re transforming `git-mind` from a monolithic CLI into a clean, embeddable C library with zero warnings under extreme compiler strictness. 

__Progress__: Core library 50% complete | CLI separation 0% | New apps 0%

See [The Great Migration](#the-great-migration) below for details.

## What is `git-mind`?

`git-mind` captures and versions the connections between your code, documentation, and design artifacts. It stores these relationships as Git objects, making them as permanent and trackable as your code.

```bash
# Link a design document to its implementation
git mind link docs/auth-flow.md src/auth.c --type implements

# Find all code that implements a specific design
git mind traverse docs/auth-flow.md --direction forward

# See how your understanding evolved
git checkout v1.0
git mind list  # View connections from that point in time
```

---

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuroglyph/git-mind
cd git-mind
meson setup build
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
```

### Requirements

- Git 2.28+
- C23-compliant compiler (GCC 12+ or Clang 16+)
- Meson build system
- Ninja
- libsodium
- libgit2 (for Git object manipulation)

## Core Concepts

- __Links__: Directed relationships between files (e.g., “implements”, “documents”, “tests”)   
- __Traversal__: Navigate your codebase through semantic connections, not just file paths   
- __Time Travel__: Your knowledge graph evolves with your code - checkout any commit to see that era’s understanding   

## Usage

### Creating Links

```bash
# Basic link creation
git mind link <source> <target> --type <relationship>

# Common relationship types
git mind link README.md src/main.c --type documents
git mind link test_auth.c src/auth.c --type tests
git mind link design.md src/module/ --type implements
```

### Exploring Connections

```bash
# List all links
git mind list

# Find what a file connects to
git mind traverse src/auth.c

# Find what connects to a file
git mind traverse src/auth.c --direction backward

# Filter by relationship type
git mind list --type tests
```

### Advanced Features

```bash
# Export knowledge graph
git mind export --format dot > graph.dot

# Check link integrity
git mind verify

# Remove broken links
git mind prune
```

## Architecture

git-mind stores relationship data in `.git/refs/minds/` using Git’s object database. Each link is a Git object containing:

- Source and target paths
- Relationship type
- Creation timestamp
- Optional metadata

This design ensures links are:

- Version controlled
- Distributed with the repository
- Preserved through Git operations
- Queryable at any point in history

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Standard build
meson setup build
ninja -C build

# Debug build
meson setup build_debug -Dbuildtype=debug
ninja -C build_debug

# Run tests
ninja -C build test
```

## 🚧 The Great Migration

### Why We’re Migrating

We started with 11,951 compiler warnings - a technical debt mountain that was holding us back. Rather than patch over problems, we’re rebuilding git-mind with extreme code quality standards:

- __Zero Warnings Policy__: Every module in `core/` must have ZERO clang-tidy warnings
- __GNU CRY GAUNTLET__: Our CI runs the strictest compiler settings that “make GNU developers cry”
- __C23 Standard__: Leveraging the latest C standard for better type safety and modern features
- __Library-First Design__: Transform from monolithic CLI to embeddable C library
- __Single-Header Core__: Ultimate goal is a single `#include <gitmind.h>` for all functionality

### Migration Milestones

#### 🎯 Milestone 1: “Core Complete” (~50% done)

__Status__: 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜  
__Target__: January 2025

✅ __Completed (Warning-Free™)__

- Error handling, Result types
- Type system (paths, strings, IDs, ULID)
- Crypto backend (pluggable)
- Time operations (mockable)
- CBOR encoding
- UTF-8 validation
- I/O operations

🚧 __Remaining for Core Library__

- Edge system (graph operations) - ~50 warnings
- Attribution (authorship) - ~50 warnings
- Journal system (Git object storage)
- Cache system (query optimization)

#### 🎯 Milestone 2: “CLI: Oh My!” (0% done)

__Status__: ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜  
__Target__: February 2025

📋 __Application Separation Tasks__

- Extract CLI from src/cli/ to apps/cli/
- Extract Git hooks to apps/hooks/
- Create proper libgit2 integration layer
- Implement against libgitmind API
- Add modern CLI features (colors, progress bars)

#### 🎯 Milestone 3: “Beyond CLI” (0% done)

__Status__: ⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜  
__Target__: March 2025

🚀 __New Applications__

- MCP server for AI integration
- Web UI daemon
- Git hooks as separate binaries
- Language bindings (Python, Rust)

## 🚀 Beyond Migration: Coming Soon

### 🧠 Semantic Intelligence (Q2 2025)

- __AI-Powered Discovery__: Automatically detect and suggest relationships between code artifacts
- __Natural Language Queries__: “Show me all code that implements authentication”
- __Intelligent Refactoring__: Track concept migrations across architectural changes

### 🌐 Distributed Knowledge (Q3 2025)

- __Cross-Repository Links__: Connect knowledge across project boundaries
