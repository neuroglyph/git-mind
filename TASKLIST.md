## 📚 Historical Archive (Rust Implementation)

### Rust Prototype Work (Completed before C pivot)

This section documents the Rust implementation work that was completed before we pivoted to pure C on June 13, 2025. See [ADR-009](docs/decisions/ADR-009-c.md) for the decision to pivot.

#### Rust CLI Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Created initial Rust project structure
- [x] Implemented 44 passing tests
- [x] Clean architecture with dependency injection
- [x] Commands implemented: init, link, list, unlink, check
- [x] Gitoxide integration (which led to complexity issues)
- [x] Test doubles for edge case handling

#### Key Learnings from Rust Phase
- Git operations via CLI were simpler than library integration
- Rust's complexity wasn't justified for this use case
- Binary size and startup time were concerns (multi-MB binary)
- Led to the insight that C would be optimal for this tool

The Rust prototype served its purpose: proving the concept and informing the final implementation strategy. The C implementation achieved all the same functionality in 67KB vs multiple MB.
