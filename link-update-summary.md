## Verification
All internal links have been updated to match the new structure:
- Files moved from root to `project/`
- Technical docs moved from `docs/` to `design/`
- Community files in `project/community/`
- Legal files in `project/legal/`
- Meta files in `project/meta/`

## Notes
- The `docs/` directory still exists for user documentation
- References to `docs/api.md` were kept as-is since this appears to be user documentation
- All relative paths were adjusted based on the new file locations
