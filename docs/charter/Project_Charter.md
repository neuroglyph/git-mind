## Executive Summary

Build a Git-native semantic graph tool that is deterministic, fast, and friendly to a solo maintainer workflow. Favor small, pauseable increments and auditable decisions. Related: [Product Roadmap](../planning/Product_Roadmap.md).

## Goals and Objectives

- G1: First-class semantics (names-as-truth) with deterministic IDs for cache keys
- G2: Fast local queries using Roaring Bitmaps; rebuildable, branch-scoped caches
- G3: Optional advice system with deterministic merges; minimal application
- G4: CI gates on real C23 compilers; scoped zero-warning tidy
- G5: Optional export/import in open formats (CSV/JSON) with authorship capture

## Stakeholders and RACI

| Role | Person | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Maintainer | You | X | X | X | X |

Notes: One-person operation. “Consulted” and “Informed” reflect future-self/change logs and commit messages.

## Success Metrics

- S1: Query median < 10ms on 100k-edge sample; P95 < 50ms
- S2: clang-tidy zero warnings in cache/journal/cbor modules
- S3: Deterministic hash vectors green across platforms
- S4: Cohesion report summarizes merges deterministically with stable output
- S5: CI fails on toolchains < C23; canaries non-blocking
