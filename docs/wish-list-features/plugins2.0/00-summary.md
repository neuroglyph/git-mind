# Plugin Architecture 2.0: Git-Mind Ecosystem Revolution

## Overview

This project transforms Git-Mind from a standalone tool into an extensible ecosystem. By introducing a modular plugin system with support for WebAssembly, Lua/Python scripts, and native binaries, Git-Mind becomes a flexible substrate for distributed developer cognition.

## Goals

- Enable 3rd-party developers to extend Git-Mind with plugins.
- Allow secure runtime sandboxing for untrusted extensions.
- Provide a consistent API surface across languages.
- Support MIND-GPG for plugin signing and verification.
- Establish a long-term foundation for community contribution, research tooling, and commercial add-ons.

## Non-Goals

- UI extension at this stage (visual plugins will be scoped separately).
- In-core AI plugin execution (handled via plugin bridge instead).

## Stakeholders

- Internal Dev Tools team
- Enterprise adopters (internal custom workflows)
- Plugin developers
- Open source contributors
- AI-integrated dev teams (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT)

## Success Criteria

- Internal and third-party plugins can be safely loaded, queried, and run.
- All plugins declare permissions and are validated by signature or sandbox.
- Plugin manifest + CLI enable seamless development and publishing.
- No regression or performance degradation in the core Git-Mind pipeline.
