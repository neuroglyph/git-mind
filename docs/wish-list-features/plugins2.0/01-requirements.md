# Feature Requirements: Plugin Architecture 2.0

## Functional Requirements

### F1. Plugin Lifecycle Management

- Load, initialize, invoke, and unload plugins at runtime.
- Plugins may be:
  - Native dynamic libraries (`.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll`)
  - WebAssembly modules (`.wasm`)
  - Interpreted scripts (Lua, Python)

### F2. Plugin Manifest and Metadata

- Each plugin must include a manifest file (`gm_plugin.toml`) with:
  - Plugin name, version, author, permissions
  - Compatible Git-Mind API version
  - Entrypoint declaration
  - Cryptographic signature (MIND-GPG)

### F3. Sandbox and Permissions

- WebAssembly and script plugins must run in sandboxed environments.
- Manifest-declared capabilities define access rights:
  - File access
  - Network access
  - Access to internal Git-Mind data (nodes, edges, etc.)
- Native plugins require explicit CLI opt-in or trusted signature.

### F4. Plugin Command Registry

- Plugins may register custom CLI commands with argument schemas.
- Commands exposed via `git mind plugin run <name> --args`.

### F5. Event Hook System

- Plugins can subscribe to internal Git-Mind events:
  - `on_edge_created`
  - `on_commit_analyzed`
  - `on_node_updated`
  - `on_graph_query`

### F6. Plugin Marketplace Support (future)

- Plugin metadata structured for discoverability and future publication to a registry.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1. Performance

- Plugin system must not degrade core pipeline performance.
- Plugins load lazily; must support “safe mode” disabling.

### NFR2. Security

- Sandbox enforcement for non-native plugins.
- Digital signature validation for MIND-GPG signed plugins.
- No access to host OS resources without declared permissions.

### NFR3. Portability

- WebAssembly runtime is cross-platform.
- Host-side plugin manager compatible with Linux, macOS, Windows.

### NFR4. Backward Compatibility

- Plugin ABI and API versions must be versioned.
- Core system should tolerate unknown plugin versions gracefully.

## User Stories

### US01 – Internal Dev

> As a Git-Mind engineer, I want to register a plugin that refactors graph structures so I can prototype internal AI ideas without touching core logic.

### US02 – Open Source Dev

> As an external contributor, I want to write a Lua plugin that tags suspicious edge relationships, and share it with others securely.

### US03 – Security-Conscious User

> As a user at a financial institution, I want to restrict plugin loading to MIND-GPG-signed modules to meet compliance.

### US04 – Plugin Dev

> As a plugin developer, I want to test, publish, and distribute my plugin using a CLI toolkit that supports signing and manifest generation.

### US05 – AI System

> As a language model with plugin access, I want to analyze graph evolution and attach natural-language commentary as metadata nodes.
