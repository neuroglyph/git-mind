# Security Review: Plugin Architecture 2.0

## Summary

This document outlines the risks and protections involved in supporting native, WASM, and script-based plugin execution. The system enables untrusted third-party code to run in the context of the host application ‚Äî __extremely high risk__ unless sandboxed, signed, and isolated.

---

## üî• Threat Model

| Threat | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|------|------------|
| Remote code execution | CRITICAL | WASM sandbox, native plugin disallowed by default |
| Privilege escalation | HIGH | Capability-based manifest system |
| ABI compromise | HIGH | Versioned API boundaries, runtime checks |
| Supply chain attack | HIGH | MIND-GPG plugin signing required |
| Infinite loop / DoS | MEDIUM | Execution timeout and memory limits |
| Information leakage | HIGH | No direct FS/network access for unprivileged plugins |
| Plugin impersonation | HIGH | Manifest `id` + GPG fingerprint required |
| Log pollution / spoofing | MEDIUM | Namespaced plugin log channels |
| Upgrade sabotage | HIGH | Core must never auto-load unsigned/unknown binaries |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è MIND-GPG Signing

Plugins must be signed using MIND-GPG ‚Äî a Git-mind-specific GPG wrapper enforcing minimum key length, revocation support, and fingerprint checks.

### Required Manifest Fields

```toml
[identity]
plugin_id = "com.gitmind.refactorbot"
public_key = "FINGERPRINT"
signature = "BASE64_GPG_SIG"

[permissions]
filesystem = false
network = false
memory_limit = "32mb"
````

## __MIND-GPG CLI__

```
# Sign a plugin
gm gpg sign plugin.so

# Verify on load
gm plugin load plugin.so --verify

# Trust chain verification
gm gpg trust-list
```

---

# __üß± Sandboxing Enforcement__

|__Plugin Type__|__Isolation__|__Controls__|
|---|---|---|
|Native|Process boundary|Optional: `seccomp`, `LD_PRELOAD` jail|
|WASM|Full sandbox|No syscall access, memory caps|
|Script (Lua/JS)|Runtime VM|Whitelisted API access only|

---

# __üîí Defense-in-Depth Layers__

1. __Static validation__ of all manifests
2. __Version pinning__ for stable APIs
3. __Signature chain__ verification before execution
4. __Runtime sandbox__ per plugin
5. __Scoped logs__, memory, and error boundaries
6. __Capability gating__ based on manifest flags
7. __Safe-mode__ launch to disable all plugins

---

# __üö® Escalation Procedures__

- Plugin exploits must be revocable via fingerprint blacklist
- All plugins auto-upgrade on patch push
- Emergency CLI command:

```
gm plugin revoke com.gitmind.refactorbot
gm plugin blacklist update
```

---

# __Security Best Practices for Plugin Authors__

- No filesystem access unless absolutely required
- All user input must be validated
- Avoid using unsafe (in Rust/WASM or Native)
- Prefer stateless design ‚Äî shared memory = shared pain
- Never execute external binaries or scripts
- Do not assume default permissions

---

# __Open Risks (To Monitor)__

- Plugins manipulating plugin system itself
- ABI evolution (v3 breaking v2)
- WASM engine bugs
- Overly permissive manifest specs

---

# __Final Verdict__

‚úÖ __Permissible with Hard Walls__:

This plugin system can be safely deployed _if_ the following are mandatory:

- WASM-first
- Signing required
- Explicit capability declarations
- Runtime sandboxing

üö´ __Do Not Allow:__

- Auto-discovery + auto-execution
- Unverified binaries
- Script eval from untrusted source

---

# __Next Steps__

1. Build `gm gpg` tooling
2. Define sandbox contracts per plugin type
3. Integrate `--safe-mode` CLI
4. Require `plugin.manifest.toml` for all plugin loads
