- Backlog audit: Labeled 94 legacy GitHub issues (`possibly-wont-do` / `possibly-done`) and copied the possibly-wont-do set into `docs/features/Features_Ledger.md` for review.
- Documentation: Added a "Legacy Backlog" section to the Features Ledger grouping dormant ideas by milestone and captured the triage lesson in `AGENTS.md`.

- CI/CD: Added Markdown linting with repo-aligned rules (`.markdownlint.jsonc`), `make md-lint`/`md-fix` targets, and path filters limiting core workflows to code paths. Enabled docker pull retry and set `GITMIND_SAFETY=off` for E2E in the core workflow.
- Header hygiene: Standardized header guards to `GITMIND_*`, added umbrella viability check (public headers compile standalone), and a header guard linter (`tools/quality/check_header_guards.py`) wired via Meson run target.
- OID-first migration: Introduced `typedef git_oid gm_oid_t` and `GM_OID_RAWSZ`. Migrated edges, cache queries, and hooks APIs to OID-first and switched equality to `git_oid_cmp`. Maintained compatibility where needed; CBOR decode backfills OIDs from legacy fields temporarily.
- Journal safety: Base64-encoded CBOR commit messages on write and decoded on read; added strict `gm_snprintf` overflow checks and security-conscious includes.
- CLI fixes: Adjusted `apps/cli` commands for include hygiene, error handling, and consistent porcelain output; freed libgit2 arrays correctly.
- Reviews/PRs: Pushed branches, resolved merge conflicts, and responded to CodeRabbit with summary feedback. Opened a PR for CodeRabbit + markdownlint config changes and updated PRs addressing invalid path errors and core cleanup.
