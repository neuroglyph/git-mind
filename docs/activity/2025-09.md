## 2025-09-29

2025-09-29
- GM OID utilities: added `gm_oid_from_raw`, `gm_oid_from_hex`, `gm_oid_equal`, and `gm_oid_is_zero`, then rewired edge encode/decode, cache metadata checks, hooks, and the journal writer to consume the port-friendly helpers (no direct libgit2 helpers remain in those paths).
- Cache stability: zero-initialize cache metadata before reuse to avoid garbage OID bytes and eliminate the sporadic cache-query assertion we hit during `make ci-local`.
- Test update sweep: migrated unit tests off `git_oid_fromraw/git_oid_cmp` to the new helpers and asserted return codes so fixtures stay aligned with the hexagonal seams.
- Strict equality follow-through:
  - Added cache/journal regression tests covering binary-first comparisons and string fallbacks.
  - Updated `docs/TECHNICAL.md`, refreshed CLI docs to speak OID-first, and adjusted the legacy SHA deprecation ADR; Features Ledger now tracks GM.MVP.T001 at 100% complete.
- Ref utils hardening:
  - Expanded `test_ref_utils` with negative coverage (empty names, leading/trailing slashes, forbidden characters, substrings `..`/`@{`, buffer-too-small handling) and verified explicit `GM_ERR_*` codes.
  - Refreshed `docs/architecture/Ref_Name_Validation.md` and logged the clang-tidy backlog snapshot (`docs/quality/Clang_Tidy_Backlog_2025-09-29.md`); Features Ledger now shows GM.MVP.T002 at 75%.
- Post-merge wrap-up:
  - Solved today: reconciled CodeRabbit feedback (safe string usage in cache query tests, `gm_oid_is_zero` semantics) and merged PR #173; local branch rebased on `origin/main`.
  - Still outstanding: chase remaining libgit2 call sites in CLI/bench utilities.
  - Immediate next move: start `feat/next-hex-task` off `origin/main`, scope the follow-up equality/documentation work, and prep the next hex migration slice.
  - Unscheduled but important: schedule time for worksheet automation cleanup and the CLI safety test expansion before month end.
  - Personal note: context window is getting crowdedâ€”remember to summarize outstanding decisions before diving into the next refactor.

## 2025-09-20

2025-09-20
- Filesystem port evolution: introduced mode-aware canonicalization (`LOGICAL`, `PHYSICAL_EXISTING`, `PHYSICAL_CREATE_OK`) so callers opt into realpath semantics; default remains logical normalization for non-existent paths.
- Shared helpers: added reusable logical normalizer/dirname/basename append utilities under `core/src/fs/path_utils.c` and replaced bespoke logic in the POSIX adapter with the new helpers.
- Test doubles: built an in-memory fake filesystem temp port that mirrors the production contract; updated `test_fs_temp_port` to exercise both the real adapter and the fake using the new modes.
- Tooling: meson now compiles the shared helpers and fake adapter; `make ci-local` passes with the expanded coverage.

## 2025-09-19

2025-09-19
- Hexagonal kickoff: carved attribution defaults/env loading into `core/src/domain/attribution/**`, introduced the `gm_env_port` seam with a system adapter, and kept the public API lightweight via thin wrappers.
- Tooling: added unit coverage (`test_attribution_domain`) around the new port-driven flow; `make ci-local` green with zero clang-tidy findings for the new translation units.
- Process note: recorded in `AGENTS.md` that we must confirm warning counts before picking the next module so each migration yields a measurable delta.
- Cache builder extraction: split orchestration into `core/src/app/cache/cache_rebuild_service.c`, leaving `core/src/cache/builder.c` as the adapter shim; added `gm_edge_map` scaffolding, cache-edge-map tests, and kept the new units clang-tidy clean.

## 2025-09-17

2025-09-17
- Backlog audit: Labeled 94 legacy GitHub issues (`possibly-wont-do` / `possibly-done`) and copied the possibly-wont-do set into `docs/features/Features_Ledger.md` for review.
- Documentation: Added a "Legacy Backlog" section to the Features Ledger grouping dormant ideas by milestone and captured the triage lesson in `AGENTS.md`.

## 2025-09-14

2025-09-14
- CI/CD: Added Markdown linting with repo-aligned rules (`.markdownlint.jsonc`), `make md-lint`/`md-fix` targets, and path filters limiting core workflows to code paths. Enabled docker pull retry and set `GITMIND_SAFETY=off` for E2E in the core workflow.
- Header hygiene: Standardized header guards to `GITMIND_*`, added umbrella viability check (public headers compile standalone), and a header guard linter (`tools/quality/check_header_guards.py`) wired via Meson run target.
- OID-first migration: Introduced `typedef git_oid gm_oid_t` and `GM_OID_RAWSZ`. Migrated edges, cache queries, and hooks APIs to OID-first and switched equality to `git_oid_cmp`. Maintained compatibility where needed; CBOR decode backfills OIDs from legacy fields temporarily.
- Journal safety: Base64-encoded CBOR commit messages on write and decoded on read; added strict `gm_snprintf` overflow checks and security-conscious includes.
- CLI fixes: Adjusted `apps/cli` commands for include hygiene, error handling, and consistent porcelain output; freed libgit2 arrays correctly.
- Reviews/PRs: Pushed branches, resolved merge conflicts, and responded to CodeRabbit with summary feedback. Opened a PR for CodeRabbit + markdownlint config changes and updated PRs addressing invalid path errors and core cleanup.
- 2025-09-19
- Lint cleanup: Refactored `core/src/journal/writer.c` and `core/src/journal/reader.c` for IWYU compliance, smaller utilities, and structured debug logging; resolved the clang-tidy backlog for those modules along with safety checks in `gm_build_ref`.
- Policy updates: Added history rewrite guardrails and expanded lint expectations in `AGENTS.md` to keep future hygiene work surgical.
