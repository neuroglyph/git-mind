## Code Review Feedback

Decision: Accepted
Response: Capturing CodeRabbit's reminder about title/TOC alignment; already applied via the documented diff.

### General comment — coderabbitai[bot]

> [!note]- **Accepted**
> Title/TOC fixes landed in this doc so the reminder is resolved.

Decision: Accepted
Response: Doc now includes a compliant Table of Contents and matching title/H1.

```text
_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Restore required Table of Contents and title alignment**

Per the docs guidelines, each Markdown doc needs a single H1 that matches the front‑matter title and must include a `## Table of Contents` section. This file currently lacks the TOC and the front‑matter title (`7195186ca1374dcef93a846f882a11ebbc7fb861.md`) does not match the `# Code Review Feedback` H1. Please align the title and add the TOC so `make docs-verify` will pass.

```
