Summary
- Suggestion: _üõ†Ô∏è Refactor suggestion_

Rationale for rejection
- - The current script already honors GIT_MIND and common build locations. Larger refactors (e.g., richer reporting or temp dirs) will be addressed alongside test coverage changes.

What you did instead
- Maintained current approach consistent with repository conventions and near-term goals.

Tradeoffs considered
- Pros: Minimal diffs; aligns with existing code; reduces risk.
- Cons: Leaves some polish/robustness opportunities unaddressed for now.

What would make you change your mind
- Clear repository-wide policy shift or a follow-up PR enabling this safely.

Future Plans
- Revisit after core features stabilize; track in PR #166 follow-ups.

Confidence
- 7/10. Based on current CI and style norms in this repo.
