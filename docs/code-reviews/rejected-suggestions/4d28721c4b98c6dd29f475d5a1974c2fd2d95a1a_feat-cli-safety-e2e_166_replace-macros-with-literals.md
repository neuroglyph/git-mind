Summary

- Suggestion: Fix build: replace undeclared CLI flag/prefix macros with literals

Rationale for rejection

- - The referenced CLI flags and messages are defined in include/gitmind/constants.h. Using macros centralizes strings and avoids typos; build issues were due to include paths and have been fixed.

What you did instead

- Maintained current approach consistent with repository conventions and near-term goals.

Tradeoffs considered

- Pros: Minimal diffs; aligns with existing code; reduces risk.
- Cons: Leaves some polish/robustness opportunities unaddressed for now.

What would make you change your mind

- Clear repository-wide policy shift or a follow-up PR enabling this safely.

Future Plans

- Revisit after core features stabilize; track in PR #166 follow-ups.

Confidence

- 7/10. Based on current CI and style norms in this repo.
