Title: Leave `.PHONY` ordering as-is (no functional impact)

Context
- Commit: 5965e14
- Branch: feat/changelog-and-sweep-4
- PR: #169 (CodeRabbit)
- Suggestion: Reorder `.PHONY` list to prefer primary targets first.
- Original comment: https://github.com/neuroglyph/git-mind/pull/169#discussion_r2348131225

Decision
- Rejected (cosmetic; avoid churn).

Rationale
- No behavioral impact: `.PHONY` ordering is inconsequential to build behavior.
- Minimize diff churn: Keep diffs focused on functional changes; we can batch cosmetic Makefile edits later if needed.

Risks
- None; purely stylistic.

Plan
- Leave ordering unchanged for this PR. Consider a future style pass if we establish a Makefile ordering guideline.
