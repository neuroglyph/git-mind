Summary

- Suggestion: Fix markdownlint violations: add blank lines and fix list indentation

Rationale for rejection

- - The project does not enforce markdownlint in CI; current README renders well and existing docs checks (links/TOC) pass. We'll adopt markdownlint rules repoâ€‘wide in a docs sweep rather than piecemeal edits here.

What you did instead

- Maintained current approach consistent with repository conventions and near-term goals.

Tradeoffs considered

- Pros: Minimal diffs; aligns with existing code; reduces risk.
- Cons: Leaves some polish/robustness opportunities unaddressed for now.

What would make you change your mind

- Clear repository-wide policy shift or a follow-up PR enabling this safely.

Future Plans

- Revisit after core features stabilize; track in PR #166 follow-ups.

Confidence

- 7/10. Based on current CI and style norms in this repo.
