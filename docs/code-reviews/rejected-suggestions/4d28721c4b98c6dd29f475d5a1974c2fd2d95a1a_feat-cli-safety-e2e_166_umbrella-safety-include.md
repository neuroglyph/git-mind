Summary

- Suggestion: Consider exporting safety utilities via the umbrella (if part of public API)

Rationale for rejection

- - Safety utilities are CLIâ€‘only and not part of the core public API we want consumers to depend on. Keeping them out of the umbrella avoids accidental external coupling.

What you did instead

- Maintained current approach consistent with repository conventions and near-term goals.

Tradeoffs considered

- Pros: Minimal diffs; aligns with existing code; reduces risk.
- Cons: Leaves some polish/robustness opportunities unaddressed for now.

What would make you change your mind

- Clear repository-wide policy shift or a follow-up PR enabling this safely.

Future Plans

- Revisit after core features stabilize; track in PR #166 follow-ups.

Confidence

- 7/10. Based on current CI and style norms in this repo.
