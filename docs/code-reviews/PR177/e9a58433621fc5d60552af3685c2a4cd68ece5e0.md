## CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK

### core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.c:41 — coderabbitai[bot]

_🛠️ Refactor suggestion_ | _🟠 Major_

<details>
<summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>

**Verify `gmtime_r` portability.**

The code uses `gmtime_r`, which is POSIX but not C standard. Ensure this is available on all target platforms or provide a fallback.

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if gmtime_r is used elsewhere in the codebase or if there are existing portability abstractions
rg -n "gmtime_r|gmtime_s" --type=c --type=h -C2
```

---

[tasks review_file_3/6 inspect_time_abstraction_1/1]
[observations]
- `wrap_gmtime_r` defined in `core/src/time/time.c`.
- Logging adapter calls raw `gmtime_r`, bypassing time abstraction.
- Time abstraction in `time_ops` maps to `wrap_gmtime_r`, not used in logger.
[analysis]
- Using raw `gmtime_r` risks portability issues on Windows.
- Abstraction exists to centralize portability handling.
[pending]
- Confirm `wrap_gmtime_r` has Windows fallback.
- Recommend logger use `time_ops->gmtime_r`.
[actions]
- Inspect `wrap_gmtime_r` implementation for fallback.
- Suggest using abstraction in logger.

**Replace raw `gmtime_r` with `time_ops->gmtime_r` in stdio_logger_adapter.c**  
Leverage the existing time abstraction (wrap_gmtime_r) and handle its `gm_result_tm_ptr_t` return to ensure compatibility on non-POSIX targets.

**Clarify stats output parameter behavior on error and verify implementation.**

The `stats` function documentation mentions returning `GM_ERR_NOT_FOUND` on a missing branch, but does not explicitly state what happens to the output parameters (`edge_count` and `cache_size_bytes`) on error. Per coding guidelines, output buffers should be zeroed on error paths.



1. Update the documentation to clarify that `edge_count` and `cache_size_bytes` are set to zero on error.
2. Verify that the implementation in `core/src/ports/cache/cache_query_port.c` properly zeros these outputs before returning an error.

implementation fails to clear output parameters on error; before every
gm_err_void return in stats_impl set *edge_count = 0; *cache_size_bytes = 0; to
ensure callers get zeroed outputs on failure, and update the doc comment in
cache_query_port.h to explicitly state that on failure (e.g., non-existent
branch or other errors) both edge_count and cache_size_bytes are set to 0.

### General comment — coderabbitai[bot]

```text
<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: summarize by coderabbit.ai -->
<!-- walkthrough_start -->

## Walkthrough
Adds logger and metrics port APIs and adapters, inbound cache build/query ports and implementations, an internal cache staleness helper used by cache query, context fields for optional ports, repository/journal behavior tweaks, Meson build updates, and broad documentation additions/removals and temporary git-cache artifacts.

## Changes
| Cohort / File(s) | Summary |
|---|---|
| **Internal cache staleness helper**<br>`core/include/gitmind/cache/internal/staleness.h` | New static inline `gm_cache_staleness_time(journal_tip_time, now_time, max_age_seconds)` to evaluate strict staleness. |
| **Context ports expansion**<br>`core/include/gitmind/context.h` | Adds optional `logger_port` and `metrics_port` fields and disposer callbacks; includes new port headers. |
| **Public port headers**<br>`core/include/gitmind/ports/logger_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/metrics_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_build_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_query_port.h` | New vtable-based port APIs: logger/metrics outbound ports with no-op wrappers; cache build/query inbound port interfaces with init/dispose. |
| **Cache port implementations**<br>`core/src/ports/cache/cache_build_port.c`, `core/src/ports/cache/cache_query_port.c` | Implements per-port state, vtables, validation, calls into gm_cache APIs, error mapping, and lifecycle (init/dispose). |
| **Logging adapter (stdio)**<br>`core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.h` | Adds FILE*-backed logger adapter with level filtering, ISO8601 UTC timestamps, component label, init/dispose routines, and error codes. |
| **Metrics adapter (null)**<br>`core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.h` | Adds a no-op metrics adapter implementing counter/gauge/timing vtbl and lifecycle functions. |
| **Cache query staleness refactor**<br>`core/src/cache/query.c` | Replaces inline staleness comparison with call to `gm_cache_staleness_time` and includes the new internal header. |
| **Git repository adapter tweaks**<br>`core/src/adapters/git/libgit2_repository_port.c` | Fall back to synthetic signature on git_signature_default failure; create missing ref path directories; non-fast-forward rejection requires !force. |
| **Journal writer flow update**<br>`core/src/journal/writer.c` | Treats missing ref as empty history during walks; after commit, updates target ref to new commit and propagates update errors. |
| **Build system**<br>`meson.build` | Registers new ports, adapters, and public headers in build configuration. |
| **Docs — placeholders & architecture**<br>`docs/...` (many files, e.g., `docs/PRDs/*`, `docs/planning/*`, `docs/architecture/*`, `docs/code-reviews/*`) | Large doc churn: many PRDs/plans/specs replaced with placeholders or archived, several new architecture docs and code-review artifacts, front-matter/SPDX adjustments. |
| **Temporary git-cache blobs & refs**<br>`.gm_cache_query_tmp/...` | Adds a temporary repo tree with config, refs, and multiple object blobs (non-code artifacts). |

## Estimated code review effort
🎯 4 (Complex) | ⏱️ ~60 minutes

## Possibly related PRs
- neuroglyph/git-mind#171 — Refactors cache/query.c including staleness-related logic; likely overlaps with the new staleness helper.  
- neuroglyph/git-mind#158 — Prior changes to cache staleness/time-check logic in the same area; closely related to this refactor.  
- neuroglyph/git-mind#173 — Modifies OID handling in cache/query.c and touches gm_cache_is_stale; may conflict with staleness/port changes.

## Poem
> In burrows of bytes I hop and write,  
> I timestamp logs at quiet night.  
> I nudge the cache to wake and build,  
> metrics hum softly, quiet and mild.
