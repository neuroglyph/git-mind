## CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK

<details>
<summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>

**Verify `gmtime_r` portability.**

The code uses `gmtime_r`, which is POSIX but not C standard. Ensure this is available on all target platforms or provide a fallback.

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if gmtime_r is used elsewhere in the codebase or if there are existing portability abstractions
rg -n "gmtime_r|gmtime_s" --type=c --type=h -C2
```

Length of output: 2559

---

[tasks review_file_3/6 inspect_time_abstraction_1/1]
[observations]
- `wrap_gmtime_r` defined in `core/src/time/time.c`.
- Logging adapter calls raw `gmtime_r`, bypassing time abstraction.
- Time abstraction in `time_ops` maps to `wrap_gmtime_r`, not used in logger.
[analysis]
- Using raw `gmtime_r` risks portability issues on Windows.
- Abstraction exists to centralize portability handling.
[pending]
- Confirm `wrap_gmtime_r` has Windows fallback.
- Recommend logger use `time_ops->gmtime_r`.
[actions]
- Inspect `wrap_gmtime_r` implementation for fallback.
- Suggest using abstraction in logger.
[done]

**Replace raw `gmtime_r` with `time_ops->gmtime_r` in stdio_logger_adapter.c**  
Leverage the existing time abstraction (wrap_gmtime_r) and handle its `gm_result_tm_ptr_t` return to ensure compatibility on non-POSIX targets.

## Walkthrough
Adds new cache ports (build/query) and outbound ports (logger/metrics) with adapters, introduces a staleness helper, updates context to hold ports, wires builds in Meson, adjusts git repository adapter behavior, extends journal commit flow to update refs, refactors cache query to use the staleness helper, and replaces multiple docs with placeholders.

## Changes
| Cohort / File(s) | Summary |
|---|---|
| **Internal cache staleness helper**<br>`core/include/gitmind/cache/internal/staleness.h` | New inline function `gm_cache_staleness_time` to evaluate cache age using timestamps and max-age. C/C++ compatible. |
| **Context ports expansion**<br>`core/include/gitmind/context.h` | Adds optional logger and metrics ports with disposer callbacks; includes new port headers. |
| **Public port surfaces (cache/logger/metrics)**<br>`core/include/gitmind/ports/logger_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/metrics_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_build_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_query_port.h` | Introduces logger and metrics outbound ports with safe no-op wrappers; adds cache build and query port APIs with vtables and init/dispose functions. |
| **Cache ports implementations**<br>`core/src/ports/cache/cache_build_port.c`, `core/src/ports/cache/cache_query_port.c` | Implements cache build/query ports with state allocation, vtables, input validation, error mapping, and dispose logic. |
| **Logging adapter (stdio)**<br>`core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.h` | Adds FILE\*-based logger adapter with level filtering, timestamped formatting, init/dispose, and error handling. |
| **Metrics adapter (null)**<br>`core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.h` | Adds no-op metrics adapter with vtable, state management, init/dispose. |
| **Cache query staleness refactor**<br>`core/src/cache/query.c` | Replaces manual staleness check with `gm_cache_staleness_time`; includes new header. |
| **Git repository adapter tweaks**<br>`core/src/adapters/git/libgit2_repository_port.c` | Commit creation falls back to synthetic signature; reference update ensures directories exist; force flag permits non-FF updates. |
| **Journal writer flow update**<br>`core/src/journal/writer.c` | Treats missing ref as empty history; after commit, updates ref to new commit; propagates update errors. |
| **Build system**<br>`meson.build` | Registers new ports, adapters, and public headers. |
| **Planning/PRD/spec docs placeholders**<br>`docs/PRDs/*`, `docs/planning/*`, `docs/specs/Technical_Specifications.md`, `docs/wish-list-features/README.md` | Replaces detailed content with placeholder outlines and updated metadata. |
| **Migration tracking**<br>`migration-progress.md` | Adds migration checklist document for hexagonal architecture transition. |
| **Review artifact**<br>`docs/code-reviews/PR177/47a1bf537feb065ef3cbac02a8bf78e75944111c.md` | Adds code review feedback document for archival. |

- neuroglyph/git-mind#158 — Also changes cache query and staleness logic; overlaps with refactoring `core/src/cache/query.c`.
- neuroglyph/git-mind#171 — Refactors cache/query to port-based helpers and adjusts staleness handling; intersects with this PR’s staleness extraction.
- neuroglyph/git-mind#169 — Modifies `gm_cache_is_stale` and `core/src/cache/query.c`, overlapping with the new `gm_cache_staleness_time` usage.

|  Description Check | ⚠️ Warning | The pull request description follows the general template structure but diverges in the Change Areas and Risk sections: the Change Areas checklist uses custom categories instead of the exact “Core (C)”, “CLI / Hooks”, “Docs”, and “CI / Tooling” items, and the Risk section uses a low/medium/high radio style rather than the required checkbox list for “Behavior change”, “Public API change”, and “Docs-only”. These deviations mean the repository’s prescribed template is not fully adhered to. | Please update the Change Areas checklist to use the exact template entries (“Core (C)”, “CLI / Hooks”, “Docs”, “CI / Tooling”), convert the Risk section into checkboxes for “Behavior change”, “Public API change”, and “Docs-only”, and ensure the section headings precisely match the repository’s description template. |
