## CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK

### core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.c:41 — coderabbitai[bot]

<details>
<summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>

**Verify `gmtime_r` portability.**

The code uses `gmtime_r`, which is POSIX but not C standard. Ensure this is available on all target platforms or provide a fallback.

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if gmtime_r is used elsewhere in the codebase or if there are existing portability abstractions
rg -n "gmtime_r|gmtime_s" --type=c --type=h -C2
```

[tasks review_file_3/6 inspect_time_abstraction_1/1]
[observations]
- `wrap_gmtime_r` defined in `core/src/time/time.c`.
- Logging adapter calls raw `gmtime_r`, bypassing time abstraction.
- Time abstraction in `time_ops` maps to `wrap_gmtime_r`, not used in logger.
[analysis]
- Using raw `gmtime_r` risks portability issues on Windows.
- Abstraction exists to centralize portability handling.
[pending]
- Confirm `wrap_gmtime_r` has Windows fallback.
- Recommend logger use `time_ops->gmtime_r`.
[actions]
- Inspect `wrap_gmtime_r` implementation for fallback.
- Suggest using abstraction in logger.

**Replace raw `gmtime_r` with `time_ops->gmtime_r` in stdio_logger_adapter.c**  
Leverage the existing time abstraction (wrap_gmtime_r) and handle its `gm_result_tm_ptr_t` return to ensure compatibility on non-POSIX targets.

**Clarify stats output parameter behavior on error and verify implementation.**

The `stats` function documentation mentions returning `GM_ERR_NOT_FOUND` on a missing branch, but does not explicitly state what happens to the output parameters (`edge_count` and `cache_size_bytes`) on error. Per coding guidelines, output buffers should be zeroed on error paths.



1. Update the documentation to clarify that `edge_count` and `cache_size_bytes` are set to zero on error.
2. Verify that the implementation in `core/src/ports/cache/cache_query_port.c` properly zeros these outputs before returning an error.

Both gm_telemetry_cfg_load and gm_telemetry_build_tags return gm_result_void_t, yet we drop them on the floor.

**Check `gm_strcpy_safe` return value and handle truncation.**

The `(void)` cast ignores truncation when copying `repo_canon_path`, which could be longer than the 65-byte `repo_val` buffer. Per coding guidelines, truncation must be treated as an error.



Apply this fix:

```diff
         if (cfg->repo_tag == GM_REPO_TAG_PLAIN) {
             if (repo_canon_path != NULL && repo_canon_path[0] != '\0') {

In core/src/telemetry/config.c around line 228, the call to
(void)gm_strcpy_safe(repo_val, sizeof(repo_val), repo_canon_path) ignores the
function's return value and potential truncation; change this to capture the
return, check for non-success/truncation per gm_strcpy_safe's contract, and
handle it (e.g., log an error including the offending path, set appropriate
error state/return code or abort initialization) instead of discarding the
result so truncated copies are treated as errors per coding guidelines.

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Stop recording entries when gm_strcpy_safe truncates.**

We bump the slot counter before validating the copies and ignore gm_strcpy_safe’s return codes. Any truncation leaves the state inconsistent (count advanced, partial strings stored) and violates the “treat truncation as error” rule for test fakes. Please gate the increment on successful copies, reset the slot on failure, and surface an error result so tests can fail loudly.

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Use gm_snprintf/gm_strcpy_safe in test helper.**

The helper bypasses the required safe wrappers (snprintf/memcpy), so truncation would slip by silently. Please lean on gm_snprintf and gm_strcpy_safe, check their return values, and bail if formatting/copying fails.

```
In core/tests/unit/test_cache_telemetry_emit.c around lines 4-23 (and also apply
same change at lines 110-118), the test helper currently uses raw
snprintf/memcpy-style operations that bypass the project's safe wrappers; update
the helper to use gm_snprintf and gm_strcpy_safe instead, check their return
values and if either indicates truncation/failure, fail the test immediately
(bail out) with an assertion or error return; ensure all format/copy calls are
replaced, handle and assert on non-zero/error return codes from the gm_*
functions, and remove any raw snprintf/memcpy usage so truncation cannot
silently pass.

```text
_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Check the gm_strcpy_safe result before proceeding.**

We currently ignore the return value when copying the fake repo path, so a truncation would leave `sr.gitdir` containing partial data. Please assert/handle the result instead of discarding it.

As per coding guidelines

```diff
-    gm_strcpy_safe(sr.gitdir, sizeof(sr.gitdir), "/fake/state");
+    int copy_rc = gm_strcpy_safe(sr.gitdir, sizeof(sr.gitdir), "/fake/state");

```
In core/tests/unit/test_cache_telemetry_emit.c around lines 133 to 138, the
result of gm_strcpy_safe when copying "/fake/state" into sr.gitdir is ignored
which can hide truncation; call gm_strcpy_safe and check its return value,
asserting success (or handling error) before proceeding—e.g., capture the
return, assert it indicates the copy succeeded (or fail the test) so tests don't
continue with a potentially truncated gitdir.

the expected number of bytes (strlen(content)) and handle failures: after
fwrite, compare the returned size to strlen(content), and if they differ, call
perror or assert/fail the test (ensure the file is closed before failing). This

**Move integration test to appropriate directory.**

This test uses real libgit2 adapters (`git_libgit2_init`, `git_repository_init`, `gm_libgit2_repository_port_create`), making it an integration test. Per coding guidelines: "Unit tests should use fakes only; integration tests may use real adapters but only inside Docker." Move this test from `core/tests/unit/` to `core/tests/integration/` and update the meson.build registration accordingly.


As per coding guidelines

Verify the test directory structure:

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if integration test directory exists
fd -t d "integration" core/tests/

# List other tests that might use real adapters
rg -l "git_libgit2_init|git_repository_init" core/tests/unit/

### core/src/telemetry/config.c:107 — coderabbitai[bot]

```text
_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Check `gm_strcpy_safe` return value and handle truncation.**

Both calls cast the return value to `(void)`, ignoring potential truncation. Per coding guidelines, truncation must be treated as an error, and outputs must be zeroed on failure paths.

Although `validate_key` and `validate_val` check lengths beforehand, the return value must still be checked to handle any unexpected conditions.



Apply this fix:

```diff
     gm_kv_pair_t *p = &cfg->extras[cfg->extra_count++];
-    (void)gm_strcpy_safe(p->key, sizeof(p->key), k);
-    (void)gm_strcpy_safe(p->value, sizeof(p->value), v);
+    int key_ret = gm_strcpy_safe(p->key, sizeof(p->key), k);
+    int val_ret = gm_strcpy_safe(p->value, sizeof(p->value), v);
+    if (key_ret != 0 || val_ret != 0) {
+        /* Should not happen due to prior validation, but handle defensively */
+        memset(p, 0, sizeof(*p));
+        cfg->extra_count--;
+        *dropped = true;
+        return;
+    }
```

As per coding guidelines.

```
In core/src/telemetry/config.c around lines 106-107, the calls to gm_strcpy_safe
for p->key and p->value currently cast their return values to void; instead
check each call's return value and treat any non-success (truncation/failure) as
an error: on failure zero the destination buffers (memset p->key and p->value to
0), clean up any related state, and return/propagate an error code from this
function so callers know the copy failed; do this for both the key and value
copies and ensure no truncated data is left in the struct.

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Check gm_snprintf returns per coding guidelines.**

The coding guidelines require checking returns from `gm_snprintf` and treating truncation as an error. While truncation is unlikely for numeric formatting into these buffers, honoring the guideline ensures consistency and catches unexpected failures.



As per coding guidelines

Apply this diff to check the rebuild_ok path:

```diff
     char msg[256];
     char edge_count_buf[32];
     char dur_buf[32];
-    (void)gm_snprintf(edge_count_buf, sizeof(edge_count_buf), "%u",
-                      (unsigned)meta.edge_count);
-    (void)gm_snprintf(dur_buf, sizeof(dur_buf), "%llu",
-                      (unsigned long long)meta.build_time_ms);
+    if (gm_snprintf(edge_count_buf, sizeof(edge_count_buf), "%u",
+                    (unsigned)meta.edge_count) < 0) {
+        edge_count_buf[0] = '?'; edge_count_buf[1] = '\0';
+    }
+    if (gm_snprintf(dur_buf, sizeof(dur_buf), "%llu",
+                    (unsigned long long)meta.build_time_ms) < 0) {
+        dur_buf[0] = '?'; dur_buf[1] = '\0';
+    }
```

Apply this diff to check the rebuild_failed path:

```diff
     char msg[256];
     char code_buf[16];
-    (void)gm_snprintf(code_buf, sizeof(code_buf), "%d", result_code);
+    if (gm_snprintf(code_buf, sizeof(code_buf), "%d", result_code) < 0) {
+        code_buf[0] = '?'; code_buf[1] = '\0';
+    }
```


Also applies to: 629-629

<details>
<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>

```
In core/src/app/cache/cache_rebuild_service.c around lines 606-609 (and also
apply same change at line 629), the gm_snprintf calls are not checking return
values; update both the rebuild_ok and rebuild_failed paths to capture the
return of gm_snprintf, detect errors/truncation (return < 0 or return >= buffer
size), and treat that as a failure by handling the error path (e.g., set rebuild
result to failure, log an error, and return/propagate an error code consistent
with surrounding code flow). Ensure you check both the edge_count_buf and
dur_buf snprintf results and perform the same error handling in both locations.

### core/src/telemetry/log_format.c:107 — coderabbitai[bot]

```text
_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟡 Minor_

**Zero output on all failure paths.**

The function initializes `out[0] = '\0'` at line 80, but if formatting fails after partial content has been written (e.g., at lines 88, 93, 95, 103), the output buffer retains incomplete data. As per coding guidelines, "Zero output buffers before formatting/copying on error paths."


Apply this diff to zero the output before returning errors:

```diff
 gm_result_void_t gm_log_format_render_default(const gm_log_kv_t *kvs,

```
In core/src/telemetry/log_format.c around lines 71 to 107, the function may
return errors after having written partial content to out (e.g., at the json and
text overflow/size-check return points) but currently only sets out[0] = '\0'
once at the top; before every early error return inside the function you must
ensure the output buffer is zeroed (e.g., if (out && out_size > 0) out[0] =
'\0';) so partial data is not leaked on error paths — add that zeroing
immediately before each gm_err_void(...) return in those branches.

<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: summarize by coderabbit.ai -->
<!-- walkthrough_start -->

## Walkthrough
Adds logging and metrics ports with adapters and fakes, cache build/query ports, telemetry config and log formatting, OID prefix utility, and integrates telemetry into cache rebuild. Refactors cache staleness check and updates journal commit ref update flow. Extends Meson build and unit tests. Substantial documentation reshuffle.

## Changes
| Cohort / File(s) | Summary |
|---|---|
| **Public Ports (new)**<br>`core/include/gitmind/ports/logger_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/metrics_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_build_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_query_port.h` | Introduces vtbl-based logger, metrics, cache build, and cache query port APIs with no-op-safe inline wrappers and lifecycle declarations. |
| **Context struct update**<br>`core/include/gitmind/context.h` | Adds optional logger and metrics ports with disposer callbacks and a log formatter field; updates includes. |
| **Internal Cache Utilities**<br>`core/include/gitmind/cache/internal/staleness.h`, `core/include/gitmind/cache/internal/oid_prefix.h` | Adds staleness helper and OID shard prefix API (macro and function declaration). |
| **Telemetry Config & Formatting (API + impl)**<br>`core/include/gitmind/telemetry/internal/config.h`, `core/include/gitmind/telemetry/internal/log_format.h`, `core/src/telemetry/config.c`, `core/src/telemetry/log_format.c` | Adds telemetry config types, env-driven loader, tag building, log formatter interface, and default text/JSON formatter implementation. |
| **Cache Ports Implementations**<br>`core/src/ports/cache/cache_build_port.c`, `core/src/ports/cache/cache_query_port.c` | Implements cache build/query ports: state allocation, input validation, vtbl wiring, and disposal. |
| **Logging & Metrics Adapters (new)**<br>`core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.{h,c}`, `core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.{h,c}` | Adds stdio logger adapter with level filtering and null metrics adapter; init/dispose and vtbl callbacks. |
| **Test Fakes for Ports**<br>`core/tests/fakes/logging/*`, `core/tests/fakes/metrics/*` | Adds fake logger/metrics ports with capturable state for assertions; init/dispose helpers. |
| **Cache Rebuild Service (telemetry integration)**<br>`core/src/app/cache/cache_rebuild_service.c` | Integrates telemetry: loads config, builds tags, emits logs/metrics around rebuild; switches to gm_cache_oid_prefix and GM_CACHE_MAX_SHARD_PATH; adjusts commit helper signature to optionally return commit OID. |
| **Cache Query staleness refactor**<br>`core/src/cache/query.c` | Replaces inline staleness logic with gm_cache_staleness_time call. |
| **Journal Writer update**<br>`core/src/journal/writer.c` | Treats missing ref as empty history; after successful commit, updates ref via repository port and returns status accordingly. |
| **Git Adapter adjustments**<br>`core/src/adapters/git/libgit2_repository_port.c` | Fallback to synthetic signature on default signature failure; ensures ref path directories exist; fast-forward check respects force flag. |
| **OID Prefix Implementation + Tests**<br>`core/src/domain/cache/oid_prefix.c`, `core/tests/unit/test_cache_oid_prefix.c` | Implements gm_cache_oid_prefix with validation and bounds; adds unit test validating multiple prefix lengths. |
