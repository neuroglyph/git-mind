<details>
<summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>

**Verify `gmtime_r` portability.**

The code uses `gmtime_r`, which is POSIX but not C standard. Ensure this is available on all target platforms or provide a fallback.

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if gmtime_r is used elsewhere in the codebase or if there are existing portability abstractions
rg -n "gmtime_r|gmtime_s" --type=c --type=h -C2
```

Length of output: 2559

---

[tasks review_file_3/6 inspect_time_abstraction_1/1]
[observations]
- `wrap_gmtime_r` defined in `core/src/time/time.c`.
- Logging adapter calls raw `gmtime_r`, bypassing time abstraction.
- Time abstraction in `time_ops` maps to `wrap_gmtime_r`, not used in logger.
[analysis]
- Using raw `gmtime_r` risks portability issues on Windows.
- Abstraction exists to centralize portability handling.
[pending]
- Confirm `wrap_gmtime_r` has Windows fallback.
- Recommend logger use `time_ops->gmtime_r`.
[actions]
- Inspect `wrap_gmtime_r` implementation for fallback.
- Suggest using abstraction in logger.

**Replace raw `gmtime_r` with `time_ops->gmtime_r` in stdio_logger_adapter.c**  
Leverage the existing time abstraction (wrap_gmtime_r) and handle its `gm_result_tm_ptr_t` return to ensure compatibility on non-POSIX targets.

### General comment — coderabbitai[bot]

```text
<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: summarize by coderabbit.ai -->
<!-- walkthrough_start -->

## Walkthrough
Adds logger and metrics outbound ports plus cache build/query inbound ports and adapters, introduces an internal cache staleness helper, extends gm_context_t to hold ports, implements ports/adapters and wiring, updates repo/journal behavior, refactors cache staleness usage, updates Meson, and replaces many docs with placeholders.

## Changes
| Cohort / File(s) | Summary |
|---|---|
| **Internal cache staleness helper**<br>`core/include/gitmind/cache/internal/staleness.h` | New static inline `gm_cache_staleness_time` to evaluate cache age from timestamps and max-age; C/C++ compatible. |
| **Context ports expansion**<br>`core/include/gitmind/context.h` | Adds optional `logger_port` and `metrics_port` fields plus disposer callbacks; includes new port headers. |
| **Public port headers**<br>`core/include/gitmind/ports/logger_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/metrics_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_build_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_query_port.h` | New public port APIs: logger/metrics outbound ports with safe no-op wrappers; cache build/query port interfaces (vtbls, init/dispose). |
| **Cache port implementations**<br>`core/src/ports/cache/cache_build_port.c`, `core/src/ports/cache/cache_query_port.c` | Implements per-port state, vtables, input validation, calls into gm_cache APIs, error mapping, and dispose logic. |
| **Logging adapter (stdio)**<br>`core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.h` | Adds FILE*-based logger adapter: level filtering, ISO8601 UTC timestamp formatting, component label, init/dispose and error handling. |
| **Metrics adapter (null)**<br>`core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.h` | Adds a no-op metrics adapter implementing counter/gauge/timing vtbl and lifecycle. |
| **Cache query staleness refactor**<br>`core/src/cache/query.c` | Replaces manual staleness logic with call to `gm_cache_staleness_time` and includes the internal header. |
| **Git repository adapter tweaks**<br>`core/src/adapters/git/libgit2_repository_port.c` | commit_create_impl falls back to synthetic signature on git_signature_default failure; reference_update_impl ensures ref path dirs exist and refuses non-FF only when not forced. |
| **Journal writer flow update**<br>`core/src/journal/writer.c` | Treats missing ref as empty history during walks; after successful commit, updates target ref to the new commit and propagates update errors. |
| **Build system**<br>`meson.build` | Registers new ports, adapters, and public headers in the Meson build files. |
| **Docs — placeholders & archival**<br>`docs/PRDs/*`, `docs/planning/*`, `docs/specs/*`, `docs/wish-list-features/*`, `docs/code-reviews/*` | Replaces many PRDs/planning/specs with placeholder drafts, adds archival code-review artifacts and migration-progress.md. |

## Estimated code review effort
🎯 4 (Complex) | ⏱️ ~60 minutes

## Possibly related PRs
- neuroglyph/git-mind#158 — Overlaps changes to cache staleness/time-check logic in `core/src/cache/query.c`.  
- neuroglyph/git-mind#169 — Refactors cache query staleness/load logic; likely to conflict with the new staleness helper.  
- neuroglyph/git-mind#171 — Expands gm_context_t with ports in another PR; strongly related to context port additions here.

## Poem
> In burrows of code where timelines weave,  
> I nudge the cache to build, then leave.  
> I log a squeak, and metrics hop by—  
> Fresh or stale? I sniff, I try.  
> Refs now point where commits arrive—thump-thump! 🐇✨
