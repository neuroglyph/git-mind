## Summary

This document records automated and human review feedback for PR #177 and the corresponding head commit 3b7ce522..., plus the actions taken to address it.

## Inline Comments Addressed

- Logger time ops: stdio logger now uses gm_time_ops_default() for time/gmtime_r/strftime errors; falls back safely.
- Ports headers: added API doc comments to logger/metrics/cache ports; removed unused include from logger_port.h; clarified stats() params.

## Follow-ups

- Continue cache domain extraction; add logger/metrics instrumentation with fakes and tests (tracked in migration-progress.md).
