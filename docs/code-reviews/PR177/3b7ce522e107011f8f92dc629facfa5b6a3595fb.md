## CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK

### core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.c:41 — coderabbitai[bot]

_🛠️ Refactor suggestion_ | _🟠 Major_

<details>
<summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>

**Verify `gmtime_r` portability.**

The code uses `gmtime_r`, which is POSIX but not C standard. Ensure this is available on all target platforms or provide a fallback.

---

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if gmtime_r is used elsewhere in the codebase or if there are existing portability abstractions
rg -n "gmtime_r|gmtime_s" --type=c --type=h -C2
```

Length of output: 2559

---

[tasks review_file_3/6 inspect_time_abstraction_1/1]
[observations]
- `wrap_gmtime_r` defined in `core/src/time/time.c`.
- Logging adapter calls raw `gmtime_r`, bypassing time abstraction.
- Time abstraction in `time_ops` maps to `wrap_gmtime_r`, not used in logger.
[analysis]
- Using raw `gmtime_r` risks portability issues on Windows.
- Abstraction exists to centralize portability handling.
[pending]
- Confirm `wrap_gmtime_r` has Windows fallback.
- Recommend logger use `time_ops->gmtime_r`.
[actions]
- Inspect `wrap_gmtime_r` implementation for fallback.
- Suggest using abstraction in logger.
[done]

**Replace raw `gmtime_r` with `time_ops->gmtime_r` in stdio_logger_adapter.c**  
Leverage the existing time abstraction (wrap_gmtime_r) and handle its `gm_result_tm_ptr_t` return to ensure compatibility on non-POSIX targets.

### General comment — coderabbitai[bot]

```text
<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: summarize by coderabbit.ai -->
<!-- walkthrough_start -->

## Walkthrough
Adds new cache ports (build/query) and outbound ports (logger/metrics) with adapters, introduces a staleness helper, updates context to hold ports, wires builds in Meson, adjusts git repository adapter behavior, extends journal commit flow to update refs, refactors cache query to use the staleness helper, and replaces multiple docs with placeholders.

## Changes
| Cohort / File(s) | Summary |
|---|---|
| **Internal cache staleness helper**<br>`core/include/gitmind/cache/internal/staleness.h` | New inline function `gm_cache_staleness_time` to evaluate cache age using timestamps and max-age. C/C++ compatible. |
| **Context ports expansion**<br>`core/include/gitmind/context.h` | Adds optional `logger_port` and `metrics_port` fields with disposer callbacks; includes new port headers. |
| **Public port surfaces (cache/logger/metrics)**<br>`core/include/gitmind/ports/logger_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/metrics_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_build_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_query_port.h` | Adds logger and metrics outbound ports with safe no-op wrappers; adds cache build/query port APIs (vtables, init/dispose). |
| **Cache ports implementations**<br>`core/src/ports/cache/cache_build_port.c`, `core/src/ports/cache/cache_query_port.c` | Implements cache build/query ports: per-port state, vtables, input validation, calls into gm_cache APIs, error mapping, and dispose logic. |
| **Logging adapter (stdio)**<br>`core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.h` | Adds FILE\*-based logger adapter with level filtering, ISO8601 timestamps, component labeling, init/dispose, and error codes. |
| **Metrics adapter (null)**<br>`core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.h` | Adds a no-op metrics adapter (counter/gauge/timing) with vtable, state allocation, init/dispose. |
| **Cache query staleness refactor**<br>`core/src/cache/query.c` | Replaces manual staleness check with `gm_cache_staleness_time`; includes the new internal header. |
| **Git repository adapter tweaks**<br>`core/src/adapters/git/libgit2_repository_port.c` | Commit creation falls back to a synthetic signature when needed; reference update ensures ref path directories exist and respects force flag for non-fast-forward updates. |
| **Journal writer flow update**<br>`core/src/journal/writer.c` | Treats missing ref as empty history during walks; after successful commit, updates the ref to the new commit and propagates update errors. |
| **Build system**<br>`meson.build` | Registers new ports, adapters, and public headers in the build configuration. |
| **Planning/PRD/spec docs placeholders**<br>`docs/PRDs/*`, `docs/planning/*`, `docs/specs/Technical_Specifications.md`, `docs/wish-list-features/README.md` | Replaces detailed content with placeholder outlines and updated metadata across multiple docs. |
| **Migration tracking**<br>`migration-progress.md` | Adds migration checklist for hexagonal architecture transition. |
| **Review artifact**<br>`docs/code-reviews/PR177/47a1bf537feb065ef3cbac02a8bf78e75944111c.md` | Adds a code review feedback archival document.

## Estimated code review effort

## Possibly related PRs
- neuroglyph/git-mind#158 — Overlaps changes to cache staleness/time-check logic in `core/src/cache/query.c`.
- neuroglyph/git-mind#169 — Modifies cache/query staleness/load logic and may conflict with the extracted staleness helper.
- neuroglyph/git-mind#171 — Refactors cache/query and staleness-related flows; closely related to this PR’s cache changes.

## Poem
> In burrows of code where the timelines weave,  
> I nudge the cache to build, then leave.  
> I log a squeak, metrics hop by—  
> Fresh or stale? I sniff, I try.  
> Refs now point where commits arrive—thump-thump! 🐇✨
