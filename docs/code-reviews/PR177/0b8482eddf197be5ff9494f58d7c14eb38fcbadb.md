<details>
<summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>

**Verify `gmtime_r` portability.**

The code uses `gmtime_r`, which is POSIX but not C standard. Ensure this is available on all target platforms or provide a fallback.

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if gmtime_r is used elsewhere in the codebase or if there are existing portability abstractions
rg -n "gmtime_r|gmtime_s" --type=c --type=h -C2
```

[tasks review_file_3/6 inspect_time_abstraction_1/1]
[observations]
- `wrap_gmtime_r` defined in `core/src/time/time.c`.
- Logging adapter calls raw `gmtime_r`, bypassing time abstraction.
- Time abstraction in `time_ops` maps to `wrap_gmtime_r`, not used in logger.
[analysis]
- Using raw `gmtime_r` risks portability issues on Windows.
- Abstraction exists to centralize portability handling.
[pending]
- Confirm `wrap_gmtime_r` has Windows fallback.
- Recommend logger use `time_ops->gmtime_r`.
[actions]
- Inspect `wrap_gmtime_r` implementation for fallback.
- Suggest using abstraction in logger.

**Replace raw `gmtime_r` with `time_ops->gmtime_r` in stdio_logger_adapter.c**  
Leverage the existing time abstraction (wrap_gmtime_r) and handle its `gm_result_tm_ptr_t` return to ensure compatibility on non-POSIX targets.

**Clarify stats output parameter behavior on error and verify implementation.**

The `stats` function documentation mentions returning `GM_ERR_NOT_FOUND` on a missing branch, but does not explicitly state what happens to the output parameters (`edge_count` and `cache_size_bytes`) on error. Per coding guidelines, output buffers should be zeroed on error paths.



1. Update the documentation to clarify that `edge_count` and `cache_size_bytes` are set to zero on error.
2. Verify that the implementation in `core/src/ports/cache/cache_query_port.c` properly zeros these outputs before returning an error.

Both gm_telemetry_cfg_load and gm_telemetry_build_tags return gm_result_void_t, yet we drop them on the floor.

**Check `gm_strcpy_safe` return value and handle truncation.**

The `(void)` cast ignores truncation when copying `repo_canon_path`, which could be longer than the 65-byte `repo_val` buffer. Per coding guidelines, truncation must be treated as an error.



Apply this fix:

```diff
         if (cfg->repo_tag == GM_REPO_TAG_PLAIN) {
             if (repo_canon_path != NULL && repo_canon_path[0] != '\0') {

In core/src/telemetry/config.c around line 228, the call to
(void)gm_strcpy_safe(repo_val, sizeof(repo_val), repo_canon_path) ignores the
function's return value and potential truncation; change this to capture the
return, check for non-success/truncation per gm_strcpy_safe's contract, and
handle it (e.g., log an error including the offending path, set appropriate
error state/return code or abort initialization) instead of discarding the
result so truncated copies are treated as errors per coding guidelines.

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Stop recording entries when gm_strcpy_safe truncates.**

We bump the slot counter before validating the copies and ignore gm_strcpy_safe’s return codes. Any truncation leaves the state inconsistent (count advanced, partial strings stored) and violates the “treat truncation as error” rule for test fakes. Please gate the increment on successful copies, reset the slot on failure, and surface an error result so tests can fail loudly.

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Use gm_snprintf/gm_strcpy_safe in test helper.**

The helper bypasses the required safe wrappers (snprintf/memcpy), so truncation would slip by silently. Please lean on gm_snprintf and gm_strcpy_safe, check their return values, and bail if formatting/copying fails.

```
In core/tests/unit/test_cache_telemetry_emit.c around lines 4-23 (and also apply
same change at lines 110-118), the test helper currently uses raw
snprintf/memcpy-style operations that bypass the project's safe wrappers; update
the helper to use gm_snprintf and gm_strcpy_safe instead, check their return
values and if either indicates truncation/failure, fail the test immediately
(bail out) with an assertion or error return; ensure all format/copy calls are
replaced, handle and assert on non-zero/error return codes from the gm_*
functions, and remove any raw snprintf/memcpy usage so truncation cannot
silently pass.

```text
_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Check the gm_strcpy_safe result before proceeding.**

We currently ignore the return value when copying the fake repo path, so a truncation would leave `sr.gitdir` containing partial data. Please assert/handle the result instead of discarding it.

As per coding guidelines

```diff
-    gm_strcpy_safe(sr.gitdir, sizeof(sr.gitdir), "/fake/state");
+    int copy_rc = gm_strcpy_safe(sr.gitdir, sizeof(sr.gitdir), "/fake/state");

```
In core/tests/unit/test_cache_telemetry_emit.c around lines 133 to 138, the
result of gm_strcpy_safe when copying "/fake/state" into sr.gitdir is ignored
which can hide truncation; call gm_strcpy_safe and check its return value,
asserting success (or handling error) before proceeding—e.g., capture the
return, assert it indicates the copy succeeded (or fail the test) so tests don't
continue with a potentially truncated gitdir.

the expected number of bytes (strlen(content)) and handle failures: after
fwrite, compare the returned size to strlen(content), and if they differ, call
perror or assert/fail the test (ensure the file is closed before failing). This

**Move integration test to appropriate directory.**

This test uses real libgit2 adapters (`git_libgit2_init`, `git_repository_init`, `gm_libgit2_repository_port_create`), making it an integration test. Per coding guidelines: "Unit tests should use fakes only; integration tests may use real adapters but only inside Docker." Move this test from `core/tests/unit/` to `core/tests/integration/` and update the meson.build registration accordingly.


As per coding guidelines

Verify the test directory structure:

🏁 Script executed:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Check if integration test directory exists
fd -t d "integration" core/tests/

# List other tests that might use real adapters
rg -l "git_libgit2_init|git_repository_init" core/tests/unit/

### core/src/telemetry/config.c:107 — coderabbitai[bot]

```text
_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Check `gm_strcpy_safe` return value and handle truncation.**

Both calls cast the return value to `(void)`, ignoring potential truncation. Per coding guidelines, truncation must be treated as an error, and outputs must be zeroed on failure paths.

Although `validate_key` and `validate_val` check lengths beforehand, the return value must still be checked to handle any unexpected conditions.



Apply this fix:

```diff
     gm_kv_pair_t *p = &cfg->extras[cfg->extra_count++];
-    (void)gm_strcpy_safe(p->key, sizeof(p->key), k);
-    (void)gm_strcpy_safe(p->value, sizeof(p->value), v);
+    int key_ret = gm_strcpy_safe(p->key, sizeof(p->key), k);
+    int val_ret = gm_strcpy_safe(p->value, sizeof(p->value), v);
+    if (key_ret != 0 || val_ret != 0) {
+        /* Should not happen due to prior validation, but handle defensively */
+        memset(p, 0, sizeof(*p));
+        cfg->extra_count--;
+        *dropped = true;
+        return;
+    }
```

As per coding guidelines.

```
In core/src/telemetry/config.c around lines 106-107, the calls to gm_strcpy_safe
for p->key and p->value currently cast their return values to void; instead
check each call's return value and treat any non-success (truncation/failure) as
an error: on failure zero the destination buffers (memset p->key and p->value to
0), clean up any related state, and return/propagate an error code from this
function so callers know the copy failed; do this for both the key and value
copies and ensure no truncated data is left in the struct.

_⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_

**Add required "## Table of Contents" section.**

The document has proper front matter, SPDX header, and H1 title, but is missing the required "## Table of Contents" section. Per coding guidelines, all docs must include a Table of Contents after the H1.



Add the section after line 14:

In docs/operations/Telemetry_Config.md around lines 1 to 14, the document lacks
the required "## Table of Contents" section immediately after the H1; add a new
section header "## Table of Contents" right after line 14 and populate it with a
short TOC listing the major headings in the file (e.g., Overview, Logging,
Metrics, Configuration, Examples, References) using markdown link entries so the
doc conforms to the coding guidelines.

### General comment — coderabbitai[bot]

<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: summarize by coderabbit.ai -->
<!-- walkthrough_start -->

## Walkthrough
Adds port-based logging/metrics and cache build/query APIs and adapters, introduces telemetry and OID-prefix helpers, factors cache staleness into an internal inline helper, adjusts git/journal behaviors, adds tests/fakes, updates Meson, and performs large documentation rework and temporary git-cache artifacts.

## Changes
| Cohort / File(s) | Summary |
|---|---|
| **Internal cache helper**<br>`core/include/gitmind/cache/internal/staleness.h` | New static-inline `gm_cache_staleness_time(journal_tip_time, now_time, max_age_seconds)` to evaluate strict staleness. |
| **Context expansion**<br>`core/include/gitmind/context.h` | Adds optional `logger_port` and `metrics_port` fields plus disposer callbacks; includes new port headers. |
| **Public port headers**<br>`core/include/gitmind/ports/logger_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/metrics_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_build_port.h`, `core/include/gitmind/ports/cache_query_port.h` | Adds vtable-based port APIs: logger/metrics outbound ports with no-op wrappers and cache build/query inbound port interfaces with init/dispose declarations. |
| **Cache port implementations**<br>`core/src/ports/cache/cache_build_port.c`, `core/src/ports/cache/cache_query_port.c` | Implements per-port state, vtables, validation, calls into gm_cache APIs, error mapping, and lifecycle (init/dispose). |
| **Logging adapter (stdio)**<br>`core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/logging/stdio_logger_adapter.h` | New FILE*-backed logger adapter with level filtering, ISO8601 UTC timestamps, component label, init/dispose routines, and error handling. |
| **Metrics adapter (null)**<br>`core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.c`, `core/src/adapters/metrics/null_metrics_adapter.h` | New no-op metrics adapter implementing counter/gauge/timing vtbl and lifecycle functions. |
| **Domain: OID prefix & telemetry config**<br>`core/include/gitmind/cache/internal/oid_prefix.h`, `core/src/domain/cache/oid_prefix.c`, `core/include/gitmind/telemetry/internal/config.h`, `core/src/telemetry/config.c` | Adds `gm_cache_oid_prefix` implementation and telemetry config/load + tag-building logic for telemetry and metrics gating. |
| **Cache staleness refactor**<br>`core/src/cache/query.c` | Replaces inline time comparison with `gm_cache_staleness_time` and includes the new internal header. |
| **Git repository adapter tweaks**<br>`core/src/adapters/git/libgit2_repository_port.c` | Fallback to synthetic signature if git_signature_default fails; create missing ref path directories; non-fast-forward rejection respects `force`. |
| **Journal writer flow**<br>`core/src/journal/writer.c` | Treat missing ref as empty history in walks; capture commit result and update target ref to new commit, propagating update errors. |
| **App cache rebuild service**<br>`core/src/app/cache/cache_rebuild_service.c` | Uses `gm_cache_oid_prefix`, telemetry config/tags, metrics emission, final-commit tracking; replaces local shard-size constant with `GM_CACHE_MAX_SHARD_PATH`. |
| **Tests & fakes**<br>`core/tests/fakes/*`, `core/tests/unit/test_cache_oid_prefix.c`, `core/tests/unit/test_cache_telemetry_emit.c`, `core/tests/unit/test_telemetry_cfg.c` | Adds fake logger/metrics adapters for tests and unit tests for oid prefix and telemetry config/emission. |
| **Build system**<br>`meson.build` | Registers new ports/adapters, exposes new public headers, and adds new test targets. |
| **Docs — placeholders & architecture**<br>`docs/...` (many files) | Extensive documentation churn: placeholder replacements, new architecture docs, planning/migration artifacts, SPDX/front-matter hygiene, and code-review archives. |
| **Temporary git-cache artifacts**<br>`.gm_cache_query_tmp/...` | Adds a temporary repo tree with config, refs, and multiple object blobs (non-code artifacts). |

## Estimated code review effort
🎯 4 (Complex) | ⏱️ ~60 minutes

## Possibly related PRs
- neuroglyph/git-mind#169 — Adds/uses the same internal staleness helper and updates cache/query to call it.  
- neuroglyph/git-mind#165 — Refactors cache/query and OID/layout handling; likely overlaps with cache changes.  
- neuroglyph/git-mind#158 — Also modifies cache query staleness/time logic and may conflict with the new helper.

## Poem
> In burrows of bytes I hop and write,  
> I timestamp logs beneath the night.  
> I nudge the cache to wake and build,  
> count metrics small and soft and chilled.  
> Refs find their home — a rabbit's delight. 🐇
