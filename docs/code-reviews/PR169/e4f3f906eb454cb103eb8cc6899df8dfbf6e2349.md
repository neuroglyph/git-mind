## CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK

The following section contains the feedback items, extracted from the code review linked above. Please read each item and respond with your decision by injecting one of the two above templates beneath the feedback item.

### Broaden CHANGELOG detection in pre-push hook

```text
.githooks/pre-push around line 26: the current check only matches the exact
filename 'CHANGELOG.md' (case-sensitive) and will miss variants like
'CHANGES.md', 'CHANGELOG' or different casing and paths; update the git diff
grep to use the quoted "$range", use grep -i (case-insensitive) and -E with a
regex that matches filenames or paths ending with CHANGELOG or CHANGES
optionally followed by .md, e.g. use grep -iqE
'(^|.*/)(CHANGELOG|CHANGES)(\.md)?$' so the hook correctly detects all common
changelog filename variants.
```

> [!note]- **Acceepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 9/10 | Regex and quoting are straightforward; covers common variants. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Hooks must be resilient to common filename variants and path locations. Quote git ranges and use case-insensitive, anchored patterns.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> - Updated `.githooks/pre-push` to quote the diff range and use `grep -iqE '(^|.*/)(CHANGELOG|CHANGES)(\.md)?$'` on `git diff --name-only` output.
> - Improved error message to mention supported variants and how to add an entry.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> - Keep the hook in-repo and exercised by contributors on push to `main`.
> - Documented bypass via `HOOKS_BYPASS=1` to reduce friction when needed.
>
> ## Notes
>
> Consider adding a small CI job that enforces a changelog change on PRs targeting `main` to complement local hooks.

### Add C++ linkage guards to public util/ref.h

```text
In core/include/gitmind/util/ref.h around lines 4 to 19, the public C header
lacks C++ linkage guards; wrap the declarations with extern "C" guards so C++
consumers get C linkage (add #ifdef __cplusplus extern "C" { … } #endif around
the declarations and include guards), ensuring the function prototype and any
future declarations are enclosed.
```

> [!note]- **Acceepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 10/10 | Standard public header hygiene. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Public headers should include C++ linkage guards to avoid name mangling issues for C++ consumers.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> - Wrapped declarations in `core/include/gitmind/util/ref.h` with `#ifdef __cplusplus` / `extern "C"` / `#endif`.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> - The Meson header-compile target ensures public headers compile standalone; future C++ header checks can be added if needed.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None

### Preserve ABI in gm_cache_meta_t and mark deprecated field

```text
In core/include/gitmind/cache.h around lines 46 to 48, inserting
journal_tip_oid_bin before existing fields changes the public struct layout and
breaks ABI; either bump the SONAME/version and document the break or preserve
existing layout by moving new fields to the end of the struct — prefer moving
journal_tip_oid_bin to the struct tail to avoid ABI change. Mark the old
journal_tip_oid field as formally deprecated by adding a Doxygen @deprecated tag
in its comment, and update any documentation to state it is deprecated. Also
address the potential truncation of meta.branch by either increasing
GM_CACHE_BRANCH_NAME_SIZE or documenting that gm_strcpy_safe will truncate
silently, and update comments accordingly. Ensure the chosen approach is
reflected in the header comments and release notes if SONAME is bumped.
```

> [!note]- **Acceepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 8/10 | Moving field to tail preserves layout for existing users; internal code updated accordingly. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Introducing fields into public structs should be appended to avoid ABI breaks unless a deliberate SONAME bump is planned.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> - Moved `journal_tip_oid_bin` to the end of `gm_cache_meta_t`.
> - Marked the legacy string field `journal_tip_oid` with `@deprecated`.
> - Added a comment noting the intent to keep ABI stable.
> - Documented branch field behavior and added an explicit length check in the cache builder to avoid silent truncation.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> - Favor private/internal structs for evolving storage; keep public structs backward compatible or gate with versioning.
>
> ## Notes
>
> No SONAME bump needed at this time; static library usage dominates.

### Replace GM_PATH_MAX*2 and remove oversize static buffers

```text
GM_PATH_MAX = 4096 — resolve GM_PATH_MAX*2 usage

core/src/cache/tree_builder.c:180 — char full_path[GM_PATH_MAX * 2]; Replace with a computed allocation (malloc/asprintf) or compute the required length and cap with GM_PATH_MAX; avoid static GM_PATH_MAX * 2.
No PATH_MAX usages found. The only other large static buffer is test-only: core/tests/unit/test_sha256.c:151 (char large_data[8192]).
```

> [!note]- **Acceepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 10/10 | Fixed all occurrences; tests pass. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Avoid arbitrary buffer multipliers; compute sizes or use a single constant with safe formatting.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> - Replaced `GM_PATH_MAX * 2` in `core/src/cache/tree_builder.c` with bounded `GM_PATH_MAX` buffers and safe `gm_snprintf`.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> - clang-tidy and review emphasize static buffer sanity; future large intermediate paths will use dynamic allocation when required.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None

### Detect branch name overflow instead of truncating in cache builder

```text
In core/src/cache/builder.c around lines 467-468, the call to
gm_strcpy_safe(meta.branch, GM_CACHE_BRANCH_NAME_SIZE, branch) can silently
truncate branch names >= GM_CACHE_BRANCH_NAME_SIZE; detect this by checking the
length of branch before copying (e.g., if (strlen(branch) >=
GM_CACHE_BRANCH_NAME_SIZE) return GM_INVALID_ARG) or alternatively increase
GM_CACHE_BRANCH_NAME_SIZE if longer names must be supported; implement the
chosen approach and ensure the function returns GM_INVALID_ARG on overflow
instead of performing a truncated copy.
```

> [!note]- **Acceepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 9/10 | Early return on overflow improves correctness; callers can react. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Silent truncation hides errors; validate inputs and fail fast when exceeding documented limits.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> - Added a `strlen` guard in `core/src/cache/builder.c` before copying the branch; return `GM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT` on overflow.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> - Keep bounds checking centralized via safe wrappers; write tests that exercise long branch names if this path becomes externally reachable.
>
> ## Notes
>
> Current unit tests cover cache rebuild paths; we will extend if branch inputs are user-facing later.

### Unify tree_builder path buffers to GM_PATH_MAX

```text
In core/src/cache/tree_builder.c around lines 58-59 (and also at line 180), the
code currently declares path buffers with inconsistent sizes (some using
GM_PATH_MAX*2); change those declarations so both use GM_PATH_MAX to unify path
buffer sizing, replacing any GM_PATH_MAX*2 instances with GM_PATH_MAX and ensure
any related uses/strncpy/strncat calls respect GM_PATH_MAX bounds.
```

> [!note]- **Acceepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 10/10 | Applied consistently; code compiles and tests pass. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Consistency in buffer sizing reduces confusion and risk. Prefer one constant and safe formatting over ad-hoc sizes.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> - Ensured both early and later declarations in `core/src/cache/tree_builder.c` use `GM_PATH_MAX` and safe writes.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> - clang-tidy’s checks plus periodic code sweeps for static buffer declarations.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None

### Handle gm_strcpy_safe truncation in augment.c

```text
In core/src/hooks/augment.c around lines 154 to 157, the calls to gm_strcpy_safe
that copy file_path into edge.src_path and edge.tgt_path ignore its return
value; gm_strcpy_safe returns -1 on truncation and this must be handled. Replace
the current calls with checks of the return value, detect a -1 return, and on
truncation propagate a clear error (e.g., log an explicit error message,
set/return an appropriate error code, clean up any allocated resources, and
avoid continuing with truncated paths) so the caller can handle the failure
rather than silently proceeding with truncated strings.
```

> [!note]- **Acceepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 9/10 | Path truncation should fail, not silently proceed. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Always check return codes from safe string functions; treat truncation as an error in path-sensitive code.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> - In `core/src/hooks/augment.c`, checked `gm_strcpy_safe` return values and propagate `GM_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL` on truncation.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> - Keep hook code defensive as it runs in user repos; add logging in CLI pathways consuming these functions.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None

### Use angle includes for public headers in post-commit.c

```text
In core/src/hooks/post-commit.c around line 12, the include uses a quoted path
("gitmind/security/memory.h") but this is a public header; change it to use
angle brackets (<gitmind/security/memory.h>) to follow include-ordering
conventions and prevent accidental local-header resolution, ensuring the
compiler searches system/include paths first.
```

> [!note]- **Acceepted**
> | Confidence | Remarks |
> |------------|---------|
> | 10/10 | Style and correctness improvement. |
>
> ## Lesson Learned
>
> Use angle brackets for public headers to avoid accidental local resolution and match include-order conventions.
>
> ## What did you do to address this feedback?
>
> - Switched `"gitmind/security/memory.h"` to `<gitmind/security/memory.h>` in `core/src/hooks/post-commit.c`.
>
> ## Regression Avoidance Strategy
>
> - Rely on include-what-you-use style checks and code review to keep includes clean.
>
> ## Notes
>
> None

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In core/src/util/ref.c around lines 18-22 (and similarly for lines 26-31), the
function must clear the output buffer head on any early error and properly map
snprintf results: on invalid arguments set out[0]=0 and return
GM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT; when calling snprintf set out[0]=0 before the call so
partial output is avoided on failure; after snprintf, if ret < 0 return
GM_ERR_INTERNAL, if ret >= (int)out_sz return GM_ERR_NO_SPACE, otherwise return
success. Apply the same zeroing-and-snprintf-result-mapping changes to the other
function at lines 26-31.
```

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In core/tests/unit/test_edge_oid_fallback.c around lines 15 to 25, the leading
comment "Set legacy SHA bytes different; OIDs zero to force fallback" is
incorrect because the code sets identical legacy SHA bytes on both edges; update
the comment to say the legacy SHA bytes are set identical (or matching) so that
with zero OIDs the fallback path makes the edges equal, keeping the rest of the
code and assertions unchanged.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/api/gitmind-api-reference.md around lines 1 to 9, the front matter lacks
an explicit API version field; add an api_version entry (e.g. api_version:
"1.0.0" or a semantic version string) into the YAML front matter (place it near
title/last_updated) so consumers and tooling can read the API version; ensure
the value uses a consistent format and update any downstream docs or release
process that should consume this field.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/architecture/bitmap-cache-design.md around lines 7 to 8, the YAML
frontmatter status is "stable" but the document body states "Status: IN
PROGRESS", causing a mismatch; update either the frontmatter or the in‑document
status so both read the same (choose one: set both to "stable" or both to "IN
PROGRESS"), save the file, and then run make md-lint and the docs checks to
verify the change.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/charter/Project_Charter.md around line 13, the plain "Table of Contents"
heading needs to be promoted to an H2 to satisfy TOC and markdownlint checks;
change that line to start with "## " (i.e., "## Table of Contents"), ensure
there's a blank line after the heading, and save the file so the docs tooling
recognizes it as a level-2 section.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/cli/combined_markdown.md around lines 1 to 9, this page should be marked
as an aggregate/compiled page for tooling; add a YAML frontmatter flag such as
aggregate: true (or compiled: true) on a new line within the existing
frontmatter block so tools can detect it's a combined/aggregate page while
remaining ignored by most parsers.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/cli/gitmind-install-hooks.md around lines 3 to 11, there are two HTML
license comments placed above the YAML front‑matter which breaks front‑matter
parsing; move those license comments so they appear immediately after the
closing --- of the front‑matter block. After relocating the comments, run the
provided verification commands (python3 tools/docs/check_frontmatter.py --base
docs/cli and python3 tools/docs/check_docs.py --mode link
docs/cli/gitmind-install-hooks.md) to ensure the front‑matter and links pass
validation.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/cli/gitmind-list.md around lines 1 to 11, the YAML front matter
currently starts at line 3 but is preceded by SPDX/copyright HTML comments on
lines 1–2; move those HTML comments so the YAML front matter begins at the top
of the file (i.e., place the HTML comments immediately after the closing --- on
line 11), save the file, and run the verifier: python3
tools/docs/check_frontmatter.py --base docs to confirm the front-matter rule
passes.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/enforcer/gameplans/03-observability-built-in.md around lines 1 to 9, the
YAML front matter title is "Enforcer Notes" which does not match the document H1
"Observability Built-In: Gameplan"; update the front matter title value to
"Observability Built-In: Gameplan" so the title and H1 are identical for
consistent search and discoverability (leave the rest of the front matter
unchanged).
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/enforcer/gameplans/04-testing-infrastructure-uplift.md lines 2–9, the
front-matter title is overly generic ("Enforcer Notes"); replace it with the
document’s specific title (e.g., "Testing Infrastructure Uplift" or the
canonical page title used elsewhere) so the page name matches its content,
update any related front-matter fields if necessary, and verify the site
generator uses the front-matter title for navigation so menus/search show the
new title.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/enforcer/gameplans/08-devex-internal-cli.md around lines 2 to 9, the
frontmatter title is too generic ("Enforcer Notes") and hides the page's
purpose; update the title to a specific, descriptive string that reflects the
page content (for example "DevEx Internal CLI — Enforcer Notes" or "DevEx
Internal CLI Gameplan"), keep other frontmatter fields intact, and ensure the
new title follows existing site/title conventions and capitalization.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/enforcer/gameplans/09-domain-language-purity.md around lines 2 to 9, the
frontmatter uses a generic title "Enforcer Notes" which is not content-specific;
replace the title with a concise, accurate, content-specific heading (e.g.,
"Domain Language Purity — Enforcer Notes" or "Domain Language Purity:
Guidelines") that reflects the page subject, and update the description to
summarize the doc's focus so metadata and cross-doc search return relevant
results; keep audience, domain, tags, status and last_updated intact unless more
precise values are needed.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/enforcer/specs/02-domain-types-spec.md around lines 1 to 9, the YAML
front-matter title is generic ("Enforcer Notes") but the document is actually
"Domain Types and Strong Typedefs"; update the title to a specific, searchable
name such as "Domain Types and Strong Typedefs" (and optionally adjust the
description field to match the document subject) so the front-matter correctly
reflects the page content for indexing and search.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/enforcer/BEFORE_WE_BEGIN.md around lines 1 to 9, the YAML front-matter
title currently doesn't match the document's H1; update the front-matter "title"
value so it exactly matches the file's first-level heading (the H1 text at the
top of the document), preserving casing and punctuation; ensure there is only
one canonical title string between the H1 and the front matter title for
consistent indexing.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/specs/Technical_Specifications.md around lines 1 to 9, the static
checker reports a missing "## Table of Contents" heading; add a line containing
exactly "## Table of Contents" immediately after the YAML front matter delimiter
(the closing --- on line 9) so the document includes that heading at the top and
then re-run the lint script.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/specs/Technical_Specifications.md around line 13, the "Table of
Contents" title is plain text and should be converted to an H2 header; update
that line to use a Markdown H2 header (add the H2 marker before the text),
ensure there is a blank line above and below the header for proper rendering,
and save the file.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/wish-list-features/brain-storms/plugins.md around lines 1 to 9, the
front-matter title is the generic "Wish List" which hinders indexing and
navigation; replace it with the document's H1 (e.g., "Plugin Architecture 2.0 —
[short subtitle]") by updating the title field in the YAML front-matter to match
the H1 used in the body, ensuring punctuation and capitalization match and
keeping it concise for searchability.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/wish-list-features/plugins2.0/02-tech-design.md around lines 1 to 9, the
frontmatter title is the generic "Wish List" which doesn't match the page
content; change the title to a specific one such as "Plugin Architecture 2.0 —
Tech Design" (or similar precise name that matches the page), and optionally
update the description to reflect the plugin architecture design so the metadata
accurately represents the page.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/wish-list-features/plugins2.0/03-api.md around lines 1-10 (and also
check lines 11-14), there are two consecutive H1 headings after the front matter
which creates duplicate TOC entries; remove one of the H1s (or convert the
second to an H2) so only a single H1 remains immediately after front matter, and
update any subsequent heading levels if needed to preserve document structure.
```

{response}

### {feedback_item_title}

```text
In docs/wish-list-features/plugins2.0/04-test-plan.md around lines 1 to 9, the
front-matter title "Wish List" does not match the document H1 "Test Plan…";
update either the front-matter title to "Test Plan" (or a more specific per-file
title that matches the H1) or change the H1 to "Wish List" so they align for
indexing, and ensure the description/audience/tags remain accurate after the
change.

```text
In docs/adult_swim.md around lines 108–116, the YAML front matter block is
located too far down the file; move that entire YAML front-matter block to the
very top of docs/adult_swim.md immediately after any SPDX/copyright/header
comments (i.e., place it as the first non-comment content), ensuring there is a
single contiguous YAML block delimited by --- and that no other text appears
before it so SSGs and pre-commit checks will recognize it.
