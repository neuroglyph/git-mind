# Gitmind: A Semantic Layer for Git-Based Thought Networks  
### J. Kirby Ross — January 2025

## Abstract

Gitmind is an open protocol and CLI toolchain that transforms Git repositories into semantic knowledge graphs.

By storing conceptual relationships as lightweight, content-addressable Git objects, Gitmind enables the creation of “thought links” between files, commits, projects, or even entire repositories. These links form a distributed mental model across time and contributors—allowing developers, researchers, and creators to externalize cognition, pattern recognition, and associative memory within version-controlled environments.

Gitmind is not a database, nor a web service—it is a **semantic augmentation of Git itself**, inspired by Zettelkasten, graph-based thinking, and the ethos of distributed collaboration.

This whitepaper defines the problem domain, the design goals, and the technical architecture of Gitmind. It also provides a specification for Feature 001: Link Storage, and outlines a roadmap for future capabilities such as real-time synchronization, editor integrations, chaos-mode exploration, and AI-assisted relationship inference.

## Vision

The goal of Gitmind is to build a foundation for future knowledge systems that:
- Require no central server
- Preserve long-term provenance and authorship
- Remain usable by humans and machines alike
- Enable “mental merges” across contributors, time periods, and disciplines

With Gitmind, we don’t just version code—we version thought.
