## Overview

Welcome to the git-mind command reference. These guides will teach you not just how to use each command, but why they exist and what they enable.

## Core Commands

### [git-mind](gitmind.md)

The main command and your entry into semantic version control. Start here to understand the vision.

### [git-mind link](gitmind-link.md)  

Create meaningful connections between files. This is the heart of git-mind - where understanding becomes permanent.

### [git-mind list](gitmind-list.md)

Query and explore your semantic web. Your window into the relationships that bind your code.

## Performance Commands

### [git-mind cache-rebuild](gitmind-cache-rebuild.md)

Harness the power of Roaring Bitmaps for lightning-fast queries. When your semantic web grows large, this command keeps it fast.

## Evolution Commands

### [git-mind install-hooks](gitmind-install-hooks.md)

Install automatic evolution tracking. Let git-mind follow your files as they change and grow.

## Coming Soon

### git-mind traverse

Follow connection paths through your codebase. Like `git log` but for relationships.

### git-mind unlink  

Remove connections gracefully with tombstone edges.

### git-mind status

See statistics about your semantic graph.

### git-mind gc

Compress old journal entries for long-lived repositories.

## The Philosophy

_"Look beyond what you see."_ - Rafiki

These aren't just commands. They're tools for encoding understanding. Every link you create, every query you run, adds to the collective wisdom of your codebase.

Traditional documentation tells you what the code does. Semantic version control tells you what it means.

## Getting Started

1. Start with [git-mind link](gitmind-link.md) - create your first connection
2. Use [git-mind list](gitmind-list.md) - see what you've built
3. Install [evolution tracking](gitmind-install-hooks.md) - let connections follow changes
4. When things grow, [rebuild the cache](gitmind-cache-rebuild.md) - keep it fast

## Remember

_"The past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it."_

Every command in git-mind helps you learn from your code's past and build a better future.
