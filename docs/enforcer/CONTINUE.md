# üöÄ CONTINUING THE GREAT MIGRATION

## Session Context (2025-06-22)

You're joining us mid-flight in the git-mind refactoring journey, where we're transforming 11,951 warnings into ZERO through systematic architectural transformation.

## üìç Where We Are

We're in the **Foundation Building Phase** of the migration, specifically working on Step 2 of the [ROADMAP_TO_REFACTORING.md](./ROADMAP_TO_REFACTORING.md):

**Step 2: Error Handling + Basic Types + Security Primitives** ‚úÖ SPECS COMPLETE

### What's Been Done
1. Created comprehensive gameplans for all 11 architectural capabilities (see [gameplans/](./gameplans/))
2. Refined the attack order based on dependency analysis
3. Written initial specifications for:
   - [01-error-types-spec.md](./specs/01-error-types-spec.md) - UPDATED with production feedback
   - [02-domain-types-spec.md](./specs/02-domain-types-spec.md) - UPDATED with production feedback  
   - [03-security-primitives-spec.md](./specs/03-security-primitives-spec.md) - UPDATED with production feedback

### Key Technical Decisions Made
- Using `GM_RESULT_DEF` macro to create named result types (avoids anonymous struct issues)
- Separated owned strings (`gm_string_t`) from views (`gm_string_view_t`) for clarity
- Made error codes `int32_t` instead of enum for extensibility
- Changed helper macros to be generic with `GM_IS_OK(r)` pattern
- Added URL-encoded path traversal detection
- Preserved Unicode by default in sanitization

## üìö Essential Reading

Before continuing, familiarize yourself with:

1. **Context Documents:**
   - [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Overall architecture vision
   - [MIGRATION_PHILOSOPHY.md](../architecture/MIGRATION_PHILOSOPHY.md) - Why we're doing this
   - [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) - The battle that started it all

2. **Planning Documents:**
   - [ROADMAP_TO_REFACTORING.md](./ROADMAP_TO_REFACTORING.md) - **START HERE** - The 9-week plan
   - [gameplans/README.md](./gameplans/README.md) - Index of all capability gameplans

3. **Specifications (Just Completed):**
   - [specs/01-error-types-spec.md](./specs/01-error-types-spec.md) - Error handling patterns
   - [specs/02-domain-types-spec.md](./specs/02-domain-types-spec.md) - Strong typedefs
   - [specs/03-security-primitives-spec.md](./specs/03-security-primitives-spec.md) - Input validation

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Begin Implementation

Now that the specs are complete, it's time to implement Step 2 foundations:

1. **Create the header files:**
   ```
   core/include/gitmind/result.h      # GM_RESULT_DEF and standard types
   core/include/gitmind/error.h       # Error handling infrastructure
   core/include/gitmind/types/id.h    # Identity types
   core/include/gitmind/types/string.h # String types
   core/include/gitmind/types/path.h   # Path types
   core/include/gitmind/security/validate.h  # Validation framework
   core/include/gitmind/security/path.h      # Path security
   core/include/gitmind/security/sanitize.h  # String sanitization
   ```

2. **Implement the core functionality** following the specs exactly

3. **Write comprehensive tests** including:
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Fuzz testing for security primitives
   - Integration tests for error propagation

4. **Ensure ZERO warnings** on all new code

### After Step 2 Implementation

Continue with the roadmap:
- **Step 3: Observability** - Structured logging, tracing, metrics
- **Step 4: Testing Framework** - Test runner, assertions, mocks
- **Step 5: Memory Architecture** - Arena allocators, object pools

## üí° Key Insights from This Session

The user emphasized production-level thinking:
- "The remaining 10% is the stuff that bites you in prod"
- Anonymous structs from macros create type incompatibility
- Owned flags are dangerous - C devs forget and double-free
- Path traversal attackers use URL encoding
- Unicode should be preserved by default

## üîß Technical Reminders

1. **Never commit without permission** - The user will explicitly ask
2. **All Git operations in Docker/temp dirs** - Never in working repo
3. **SPDX headers on all new files** - Use LicenseRef-MIND-UCAL-1.0
4. **Test everything in Docker** - Use `make test`
5. **Follow the specs exactly** - They've been refined based on production experience

## üìù Notes

- The "Cut-Once Edition" philosophy: Plan once perfectly, then cut with confidence
- Each architectural layer creates a safety net for the next
- We're building foundations that make excellence inevitable
- The order is the architecture - no shortcuts!
