# üíÄ Brutally-Honest Review & Non-Negotiable Marching Orders ‚Äî Core ‚Ä†2025-06-22 Build

Claude, this is your cold, clear, comprehensive reality check. If it's solid, I'll say so. If it's broken, it gets fixed **now.** No stubs. No TODOs. No "later." This is your direct order list. You will follow it exactly, in the sequence provided.

## üìä Surface-Level Scorecard

| Area              | Verdict   | Highlights / Crimes |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Error System      | A-        | GM_RESULT_DEF and GM_TRY are solid. But error messages are fixed-length ‚Äî truncation risk. |
| Crypto            | B         | libsodium wrapper OK. **No DI**: tests can't inject fake digests or RNG values. |
| UTF-8 Validation  | A         | DFA validator is fast, complete, streaming-capable. Excellent. |
| Strings           | C+        | `substring()` and `trim()` are declared but not implemented ‚Äî either delete or finish them immediately. |
| ID Types          | B-        | Strong typedefs ‚úÖ but `gm_id_hash()` only uses first 4 bytes ‚Äî **hash collision risk, DoS possible.** |
| Path API          | F         | Header exists, no implementation. **Link failure guaranteed.** |
| Build / Tests     | B         | Tests run. But no `clang-tidy`, no sanitizers, no real coverage tracking. |
| Security Primitives | N/A     | Not started ‚Äî acknowledged. |

## üö® Marching Orders ‚Äî Non-Negotiable

### 1. ‚úÖ **Delete or Implement All Declared Functions**
- `gm_string_substring()` and `gm_string_trim()` must either be implemented **now** or removed entirely.
- Every `.h` declaration must map to a real, working, tested implementation. No "coming soon" crap.

### 2. ‚úÖ **Ship a Real `gm_path.c` Immediately**
- Implement `gm_path_new()`, `join()`, `canonicalize()`, and `validate()` in `gm_path.c` with full tests.
- The current state is header-only and **will fail at link time.**

### 3. ‚úÖ **Deterministic Crypto Interface**
- Create a `gm_crypto_backend_t` interface with function pointers for SHA-256, RNG, etc.
- Default uses libsodium. Tests must be able to inject fixed-output stubs.
- No global hardcoded crypto calls in tests. Ever.

### 4. ‚úÖ **Fix ID Hashing**
- `gm_id_hash()` currently uses the first 32 bits of a 256-bit digest. This is broken.
- Use SipHash-24 (`crypto_shorthash_siphash24`) on the full digest.

### 5. ‚úÖ **Fix Error Message Buffer**
- Static 256-byte error buffer is unacceptable.
- Replace with:
```c
union { char small[48]; char *heap; } msg;
uint16_t len;
bool heap_alloc;
```
- Free dynamic allocation in `gm_error_free()`. No leaks. No truncation.

### 6. ‚úÖ **CI Must Enforce Lint & Sanitizers**
```bash
clang-tidy -warnings-as-errors **/*.c
CFLAGS='-fsanitize=address,undefined' make test
```
- CI must fail on any violation. No exceptions. No TODOs. No "I'll fix it later."

### 7. ‚úÖ **Coverage Must Be ‚â• 80%**
- Use `llvm-cov` or `gcovr`. Enforce in CI.
- The "100% of implemented functions" claim is misleading ‚Äî you're under 60% line coverage right now.
- No PR merges below 80%.

### 8. ‚úÖ **Split `gm_string.c` By Responsibility**
- Move UTF-8 logic to `string_utf8.c`
- Core alloc and growth logic stays in `string_core.c`
- Each file must have focused, isolated tests.

### 9. ‚úÖ **Ban All TODOs, FIXMEs, and "XXX" Comments**
- Add this pre-commit check:
```bash
grep -nE "(TODO|FIXME|XXX)" $(git ls-files '*.c' '*.h') && \
  { echo "NO TODOs ALLOWED"; exit 1; }
```
- If it's not done, don't write it down. Stub code is forbidden.

### 10. ‚úÖ **Merge in This Exact Order**
1. `path-impl-v1`
2. `string-ops-v1`
3. `crypto-DI`
4. `hash-upgrade`
5. `error-msg-sso`
6. `ci-hardening`

Any PR out of sequence gets auto-closed.

## üß† RESULT & ERROR USAGE POLICY ‚Äî Effective Immediately

You built a great error/result system. Start using it. Everywhere. No exceptions.

### üî• Mandatory Rule:

**If a function allocates, parses, validates, reads, writes, hashes, or touches user input ‚Äî it must return a `GM_RESULT(T)`**

### ‚ùå Violations Found:
- `gm_string_concat`, `copy`, `new_owned` return raw structs. These must return `GM_RESULT(gm_string_t)` to allow UTF-8 validation and alloc failure reporting.
- `gm_id_from_hex()` and all ID generation functions must return `GM_RESULT(T)`. You are swallowing parsing errors right now.
- `gm_random_bytes()` and all RNG helpers are `void`. They must return `GM_RESULT(void)` or `GM_RESULT(bool)`.
- Not all `gm_unwrap()` calls are guarded by `gm_is_err()` or `GM_TRY`. This is a ticking runtime bug.

### üì¶ Required Cleanup PR:

Create a PR named `resultify-everything`:
- All alloc/parse/validate/string/crypto functions must use `GM_RESULT`.
- All uses of `gm_unwrap()` must be wrapped in error checks.
- All unit tests must check for and handle error results.

## üëÆ Principle Violations to Fix

| Principle | Violation |
|-----------|-----------|
| SRP | `gm_string.c` does too much. Split as above. |
| DRY | `gm_error_format()` and `gm_error_print()` duplicate logic. Make `print()` call `format()`. |
| KISS | ‚úÖ Your string growth logic is clean and minimal. |
| YAGNI | ‚úÖ SHA-256 ctx overprovision is fine. Acceptable. |

---

## üßº Style and Cleanliness
- Use `size_t`, not `int`, for indexing into `size_t`-length arrays.
- Makefile must honor `$CC` instead of hardcoding `gcc`.
- Magic numbers like `GROWTH_FACTOR`, `MIN_CAPACITY` must live in shared headers, not `.c` files.

---

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Final Word

The stuff you've finished is good. But the unfinished parts are dangerous.

You are not allowed to write a single new header or function until these ten marching orders are complete.

We are not building a demo. We are building a production-quality system with safety, testability, and composability built in from day one.

Implement. Test. Delete. Ship. Or get out of the way.
