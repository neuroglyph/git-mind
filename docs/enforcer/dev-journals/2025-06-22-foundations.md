# Dev Journal: 2025-06-22 - Laying the Foundations

## 06:35 UTC - The Plan Crystallizes

After an epic planning session, we've got our attack order locked in. The key insight that changed everything: __"Getting names and guards in place before we spew any more pointers around is the sane move."__

### The Revelation

Started with a decent plan, but realized Domain Types were way too late at step 9. You can't build 8 layers on `char*` and `void*` then retrofit meaning - that's madness. Same with security primitives.

So we're bundling Step 2 as the __mega-foundation__:

- Error Handling (`GM_RESULT<T>`)
- Basic Types (strong typedefs)
- Security Primitives (validation from day 1)

### Why This Order Slaps

Each layer creates a safety net for the next:

1. __Filesystem Split__ â†’ Clean targets for clang-tidy
2. __Err+Types+Sec__ â†’ Every operation can fail gracefully with meaning
3. __Observability__ â†’ Watch the system as we build it
4. __Testing__ â†’ Lock in progress before touching memory
5. __Memory__ â†’ With telemetry to catch leaks immediately

The beauty is that observability comes BEFORE the tricky stuff (memory architecture). We can watch allocations happen in real-time, catch leaks as they form, not after.

### Next Steps

About to spec out:

1. `gm_result<T>` - Our Result/Either/Expected type
2. Strong typedefs for core domain concepts
3. Basic validation helpers

This isn't just fixing warnings. We're building a foundation where excellence is inevitable, where the right thing is easy and the wrong thing won't compile.

### Mood

Pumped. This plan has that "cut once" energy - do it right the first time. No more `void*` soup. No more string manipulation nightmares. Just clean, typed, validated data flowing through observable channels.

Let's fucking go. ðŸš€
