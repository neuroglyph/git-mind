# ðŸ§  Gitmind / Gonzai Core Use Cases (User Story Format)

This document outlines 10 core use cases for `gitmind`, each expressed as a user story with clear semantic and functional intent.

---

## 1. Semantic Commit Traversal

**User Story:**  
As a knowledge worker,  
I want to navigate through semantically linked commits,  
So that I can follow the evolution of an idea across time and branches.

---

## 2. Rediscovery of Forgotten Ideas

**User Story:**  
As a user with a large and aging knowledge base,  
I want to be notified when old but contextually relevant ideas resurface,  
So that I can integrate forgotten insights into new work.

---

## 3. Cross-Repository Semantic Linking

**User Story:**  
As a member of a distributed team (or a multi-repo thinker),  
I want to detect and link related ideas across different Gitmind instances,  
So that knowledge is not siloed but connected across domains and contributors.

---

## 4. Cognitive Graph Activation

**User Story:**  
As a semantic systems user,  
I want to visualize idea propagation across a graph,  
So that I can understand how new thoughts activate related concepts.

---

## 5. Meaning Through Chaos

**User Story:**  
As a creative or exploratory user,  
I want to temporarily disorder the structure of my graph,  
So that I can surface latent clusters, connections, and non-obvious patterns.

---

## 6. Concept-Driven Navigation

**User Story:**  
As a user searching by intent rather than file name,  
I want to explore my repo by conceptual similarity,  
So that I can locate all relevant materials around a theme or question.

---

## 7. Synthesis of Prior Knowledge

**User Story:**  
As a researcher or thinker,  
I want to combine multiple past ideas into a new composite insight,  
So that I can track and credit conceptual evolution without starting from scratch.

---

## 8. Temporal Knowledge Exploration

**User Story:**  
As a version-conscious user,  
I want to view past semantic states of my knowledge graph,  
So that I can compare, learn from, or reintegrate prior worldviews.

---

## 9. Semantic Merge Conflict Resolution

**User Story:**  
As a collaborator or branching contributor,  
I want to reconcile conflicting concepts from different sources,  
So that I can synthesize divergent thinking into a cohesive new idea.

---

## 10. Distributed Knowledge Integration

**User Story:**  
As a participant in a shared cognitive network,  
I want to contribute to and draw from a collective semantic graph,  
So that our individual insights can merge into distributed, versioned understanding.
