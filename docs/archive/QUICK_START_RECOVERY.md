# üöÄ Gitmind Quick Start & Recovery Guide

**Purpose:** Quick reference for continuing Gitmind development in future sessions

---

## üêµ Project Identity

**Name:** Gitmind  
**Mascot:** Gonzai (Green Chaos Monkey)  
**Core Idea:** Git as a distributed knowledge graph database  
**Revolution:** Replace databases with Git repositories for relationships

---

## üìç Current Status

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Working web prototype (needs Git persistence)
- ‚úÖ 15 feature specifications written
- ‚úÖ Complete vision documented
- ‚úÖ Project roadmap created

### Next Priority Actions
1. **Implement F001** - Git object storage (critical foundation)
2. **Update web UI** - Connect to Git backend instead of memory
3. **Create CLI prototype** - Basic `gitmind` commands
4. **Write quickstart guide** - For developers

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Key Documents

1. **Vision & Roadmap:** `/docs/README.md`
2. **Technical Whitepaper:** `/docs/git-knowledge-graph-whitepaper.md`
3. **Feature Specs:** `/docs/features/F001-F015-*.md`
4. **Use Cases:** `/docs/use-cases.md`

## üíª Current Implementation

### Web Interface (Working)
```bash
cd /Users/james/git/gitgud
node git-knowledge-graph/server.js
# Browse to http://localhost:3000
```

**Issue:** Currently stores data in memory, needs Git backend

### Key Code Locations
- Server: `git-knowledge-graph/server.js`
- Frontend: `git-knowledge-graph/public/index.html`
- Test repos: `git-knowledge-test/`

---

## üîß Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Git Foundation (Next)
1. F001 - Git object storage ‚Üê **START HERE**
2. F002 - Relationship extraction
3. F003 - Git hooks

### Phase 2: Intelligence
4. F005 - Bidirectional links
5. F008 - Query interface
6. F011 - Type system

### Phase 3: Scale
7. F012 - Performance
8. F006 - Web viz (enhance existing)
9. F007 - Real-time (enhance existing)

## üéØ Quick Wins

1. **Git Storage Proof of Concept**
   ```bash
   # Store relationship as Git object
   echo "LINK: fileA.md -> fileB.md" | git hash-object -w --stdin
   ```

2. **Basic CLI Tool**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # gitmind-prototype.sh
   case "$1" in
     "link") echo "$2 -> $3" | git hash-object -w --stdin ;;
     "query") git ls-tree refs/gitmind/links ;;
   esac
   ```

3. **Hook Integration**
   - Add to `.git/hooks/post-commit`
   - Extract links from changed .md files
   - Store as Git objects

---

## üö¶ Success Metrics

- Store 1000 relationships as Git objects
- Query relationships in <100ms  
- Web UI shows Git-persisted data
- Basic CLI working
- One happy user (you!)

## üí° Remember

> "We turned Git into a distributed database for knowledge graphs. The implications are massive - from personal knowledge management to enterprise collaboration. Gonzai helps users discover connections they didn't know existed."

**The breakthrough:** Using Git's content-addressable storage as a graph database eliminates the need for traditional databases while providing versioning, distribution, and cryptographic integrity.

---

## üêµ Gonzai Says

*"Let's build something revolutionary! Start with F001 - once relationships are Git objects, everything else falls into place. I'll be here to help you discover hidden connections!"*

**Next Command:**
```bash
cd /Users/james/git/gitgud
cat docs/features/F001-git-object-storage.md
# Start implementing Git object storage!
