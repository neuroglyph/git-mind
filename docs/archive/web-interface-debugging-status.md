# Git Knowledge Graph Web Interface Debugging - PHASE 2

**Status:** Server hanging during git scan → **ACTIVE DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS**  
**Location:** `~/git/gitgud/` directory  
**Debug Guide:** `claude-managed/git-knowledge-graph-debug-guide.md`

## CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS
✅ Web interface created and working  
✅ Dependencies installed  
✅ Server starts successfully  
❌ **HANGING:** Git repository scanning at "📊 Scanning all repositories for relationships..."

## ROOT CAUSE THEORIES
1. **Git subprocess hanging** - Most likely cause
2. **Corrupted git objects** from previous chaos testing
3. **Git authentication prompts** waiting for input
4. **Large repository operations** timing out
5. **Circular references** in commit history

## DEBUGGING STRATEGY DEPLOYED

### Phase 1: Enhanced Logging ✅
- Created debug server.js with granular logging
- Added timestamps to all operations
- Individual git command tracking

### Phase 2: Git Health Checks 🔄
- Repository integrity verification
- Git fsck and gc operations
- Manual git command testing

### Phase 3: Progressive Isolation 🔄
- Test repos one by one
- Identify specific problematic repository
- Minimal reproduction case

## DEBUG COMMANDS READY
```bash
cd ~/git/gitgud
# 1. Check repo health
find git-knowledge-test/ -name ".git" -type d | while read repo; do cd "$(dirname "$repo")"; git fsck --full; cd - > /dev/null; done

# 2. Kill hanging processes
pkill -f git

# 3. Run debug server
node server.js
```

## EXPECTED DEBUGGING FLOW
1. **Immediate:** Enhanced server shows exact hang location
2. **Diagnose:** Identify which git operation/repo causes hang
3. **Repair:** Fix corrupted git state or problematic repository
4. **Verify:** Confirm scanning completes successfully
5. **Restore:** Return to full functionality

## SUCCESS METRICS
- [ ] Server completes repository scan without hanging
- [ ] Frontend receives data and shows nodes
- [ ] Graph visualization renders git relationships
- [ ] Full cyberpunk UI displays knowledge graph

## BREAKTHROUGH STATUS
🔥 **95% COMPLETE** - Just need to fix this git parsing hang!  
🔥 **Revolutionary distributed systems visualization** ready to deploy  
🔥 **Full-stack web app** with beautiful UI waiting for data  

The fix is within reach - just need to identify and resolve the specific git operation causing the hang.
