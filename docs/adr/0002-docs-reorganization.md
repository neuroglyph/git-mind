## Status

- Accepted

## Context

The `docs/` directory had grown organically with mixed audiences and no single entry point, making it hard to pause and resume work. Planning content (roadmaps, releases, sprints) did not exist in a cohesive place, and cross-document links were inconsistent.

## Decision

1. Establish a non-destructive structure with clear hubs:
   - Planning: `docs/planning/` (roadmap, releases, milestones, sprints)
   - Architecture: `docs/architecture/` (unchanged, now linked by a central index)
   - Specs, Testing, Deployment, Requirements, Risk, Charter in dedicated folders
2. Add anchored, GitHub-friendly TOCs to major documents and use relative Markdown links across documents.
3. Create `docs/README.md` as the canonical index/map.
4. Introduce a `.legacy/` archive for historical planning/notes, and a `.trash/` quarantine for removed or superseded docs (with rationale in `.trash/README.md`).

## Consequences

- Pros: Easier navigation; project can be paused/resumed without loss of context; consistent links; planning is first-class alongside architecture/specs.
- Cons: Some existing deep links may need updates if/when files are moved into new folders. The `.trash/` process adds a minor maintenance step.
