# Roadmap (Snapshot)

Status: early stage; APIs and CLI may evolve. This snapshot summarizes active tracks. For detailed planning, see `docs/planning/`.

## Near Term

- OID‑only cache format and migration tooling
- Journal CBOR schema with explicit OIDs
- Header guard/umbrella hygiene sweep and linter fixes
- CLI safety guard polish and docs
- Focused unit tests around encoding and OID paths

## Medium Term

- Expanded CLI: query, impact analysis, attribution filters
- MCP integration for local AI co‑thought tools
- Rich conflict views and resolution flows for semantic merges

## Long Term

- Web UI for browsing semantic graphs
- Collaboration features: review lanes, suggestions, consensus workflows
- Ecosystem integrations (IDEs, docs systems)

Contributions welcome—see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
