    this.setState('curious');
    await this.lookAt(node);
    
    if (await this.findInterestingPattern(node)) {
      this.setState('excited');
      this.bounce(3);
    }
  }
  
  async onQueryEmpty() {
    this.setState('confused');
    this.spin(360);
    await this.think(2000);
    this.suggest("Try searching for similar concepts?");
  }
  
  async onConnectionMade() {
    this.setState('celebrating');

}

class AdaptiveGonzai {
  adapt(profile: UserProfile) {
