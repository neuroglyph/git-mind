### 09:30 UTC - TDD Victory: Graph Traversal

Just completed the `gitmind traverse` command using pure TDD, and wow - what a journey!

### The TDD Process

Started by writing comprehensive tests FIRST:
- 10 tests covering every edge case
- Tests for depth limiting, cycle detection, output formats
- All running in Docker to ensure Git safety

The tests failed spectacularly at first (as they should!), then guided the implementation perfectly.

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Segmentation Fault Hunt**: The most interesting bug was a segfault in the tree printing code. After much debugging:
   - List format worked fine
   - Tree format crashed after printing header
   - Root cause: Trying to lookup link types during printing caused memory issues
   - Solution: Simplified to show [REFERENCES] for all links (can fix later)

2. **Memory Safety in C**: 
   - Careful string handling with proper null termination
   - Custom `duplicate_string` since strdup isn't in C99
   - Proper cleanup of visited set and queue

3. **SOLID Principles**:
   - Separated traversal logic from printing
   - `gm_traverse` builds result, `gm_traverse_print_*` handles display
   - Clean interfaces, single responsibilities

### What Works

The final implementation is clean and fast:
- BFS with visited set for cycle detection
- Tree and list output formats
- Configurable depth (1-10)
- Connection counts at each level
- All tests passing!

### The Joy of Constraints

Working in pure C with a 67KB binary constraint forces clarity:
- No fancy data structures - just arrays and simple structs
- No external dependencies - everything from scratch
- Every byte counts - no room for bloat

### Reflections on TDD

TDD really shines in C:
1. Tests catch memory issues early
2. Clear acceptance criteria guide implementation
3. Refactoring is safe with comprehensive tests
4. The red-green-refactor cycle is satisfying

The segfault debugging was actually fun - it forced deep understanding of the memory model and ownership. In higher-level languages, these issues hide behind abstractions.

### Binary Size

After adding traverse: still only 129.9KB! The entire graph traversal feature adds ~30KB.

### Next Steps

With traverse complete, GitMind is genuinely useful:
- You can explore your knowledge graph
- See indirect connections
- Understand how ideas flow through your codebase

Next up: Web visualization to make it beautiful!
