**Topics**: F025 CLI Help System implementation, Test completion celebration  
**Conversation**: def456 (current session)

### 15:30 UTC - Major Milestone: All Tests Passing! ðŸŽ‰

Just completed the test double implementation work - all 44 tests are now passing! This feels significant:

**What we accomplished:**
- Added remaining Git edge case test doubles (WorktreeGit, SubmoduleGit, InvalidEncodingGit)
- Fixed the check command to use `git rm` instead of manual file removal
- Resolved gitoxide API issues by falling back to CLI git for 3 operations
- Updated test expectations to match actual system behavior

**Key insight about gitoxide:** We only had to replace 3 operations (add, commit, remove) with CLI calls due to API changes in gix 0.64. The `is_repository()` check still works perfectly with gitoxide. This suggests the API complexity is around index manipulation, not basic repo operations.

**Test architecture lessons:**
- Test doubles need to simulate the right layer - filesystem vs git behavior
- Integration tests need realistic expectations about error paths
- Using real Git repos in tests while isolating the working repo is the right approach

### 15:30 UTC - Starting F025: CLI Help System

Just began implementing the markdown-driven help system. Created the basic structure:
- `docs/cli/` directory
- `gitmind.md` - main command overview
- `gitmind-init.md` - detailed init documentation

**Design philosophy emerging:** 
The help system embodies the "single source of truth" principle - markdown files generate CLI help, man pages, and web docs. This prevents documentation drift and ensures consistency.

**Next steps:**
- Complete all command documentation (link, list, unlink, check)
- Implement the embedding and rendering system
- Add man page generation

James is reviewing F017 error handling design while I work on F025. Good parallel workflow.

### 15:30 UTC - Reflection on GNS-001 Impact

The git notes specification from yesterday continues to resonate. Even while implementing basic help docs, I'm thinking about how documentation itself could benefit from the notes system - confidence scores on help content, annotations about which sections users find confusing, decay tracking for outdated examples.

GitMind isn't just about linking files - it's about enriching the entire knowledge ecosystem around a codebase.
