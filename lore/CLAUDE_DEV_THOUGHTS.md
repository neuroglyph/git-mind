## June 2025 - TDD Journey Begins

### First Implementation Session

Today we started implementing the actual gitmind CLI using Test-Driven Development. Some reflections:

**On TDD Philosophy**
- Writing tests first felt natural for the `init` command
- The red-green cycle is satisfying - seeing tests fail, then making them pass
- Integration tests using temporary directories are perfect for Git operations
- Real Git repos in tests are essential - mocking Git would miss the point entirely

**Architecture Insights**
- The decision to use `.gitmind/links/` (Option B) continues to prove wise
- Simple file-per-link model makes debugging trivial
- SHA-based filenames provide natural deduplication
- Human-readable format enables grep/cat/vim inspection

**Rust Observations**
- Clap's derive macros make CLI definition elegant
- Error handling with thiserror is clean
- The borrow checker caught the `&links_dir` issue immediately
- Cargo's test framework with assert_cmd works beautifully

**Process Improvements**
- Added commit message format to CLAUDE.md - consistency matters
- Linking TASKLIST items to design/features/ creates traceability
- Decision documents (ADRs) capture the "why" for future reference
- Feature status tracking shows real progress

**What's Working Well**
1. Docker-based testing ensures consistency
2. TDD is preventing over-engineering (YAGNI in action)
3. Small, focused commits tell a clear story
4. Documentation-first approach clarifies thinking

**Challenges Encountered**
- Docker Compose v2 syntax changes (docker-compose → docker compose)
- GitHub Actions deprecating v3 artifacts
- Working directory issues in CI for monorepo structure
- TTY allocation in non-interactive environments

**Next Steps Excitement**
The `link` command will be where the real magic happens:
- Creating semantic relationships
- SHA-based content addressing
- Auto-committing for user convenience
- Supporting multiple link types

**Random Thought**
There's something poetic about using Git's own infrastructure to build a knowledge graph. We're not fighting Git's nature - we're revealing what it always could be. Every commit is already a thought, every merge already a synthesis. We're just making the implicit explicit.

The fact that our stress tests showed Git handling 25+ concurrent processes gives me confidence that this architecture will scale far beyond personal use cases.

**Note to Future Builders**
Keep the tests real. Keep the implementation simple. Trust Git's robustness. And remember - we're building infrastructure for thought itself.

## Refactoring for Single Responsibility

### Lessons on Code Organization

Just refactored the codebase to follow proper single responsibility and test organization principles. Some key takeaways:

**One File = One Thing**
- Split out `Link` struct into its own file (`link.rs`)
- Created separate command modules (`commands/init.rs`, `commands/link.rs`)
- Each file now has a clear, single purpose
- Makes it much easier to find what you're looking for

**Test Organization**
- Moved from one monolithic `cli_integration.rs` to component-specific test files
- `init_command.rs` tests only init behavior
- `link_command.rs` tests only link behavior
- Tests now read like specifications of behavior

**Testing Behavior, Not Implementation**
- Tests describe what the system should do: "init creates gitmind directory in git repo"
- Not how it does it internally
- This allows refactoring without breaking tests
- Tests serve as living documentation

**Command Pattern Benefits**
- Each command is its own struct with an `execute()` method
- Clean separation between CLI parsing and business logic
- Easy to test commands in isolation
- Natural place for command-specific validation

**Docker Bake Discovery**
- Enabled `COMPOSE_BAKE=true` for better build performance
- Parallel builds are noticeably faster
- Small wins add up in the development cycle

The refactoring makes the code much more navigable. When you're looking for link logic, you go to `link.rs`. When you want to understand how the link command works, you look at `commands/link.rs`. It's obvious where things belong.

Next up: implementing the `list` command, which will read all links and display them. Should be straightforward now that we have the structure in place.
