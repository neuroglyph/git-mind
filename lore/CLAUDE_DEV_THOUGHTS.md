## June 2025 - TDD Journey Begins

### First Implementation Session

Today we started implementing the actual gitmind CLI using Test-Driven Development. Some reflections:

**On TDD Philosophy**
- Writing tests first felt natural for the `init` command
- The red-green cycle is satisfying - seeing tests fail, then making them pass
- Integration tests using temporary directories are perfect for Git operations
- Real Git repos in tests are essential - mocking Git would miss the point entirely

**Architecture Insights**
- The decision to use `.gitmind/links/` (Option B) continues to prove wise
- Simple file-per-link model makes debugging trivial
- SHA-based filenames provide natural deduplication
- Human-readable format enables grep/cat/vim inspection

**Rust Observations**
- Clap's derive macros make CLI definition elegant
- Error handling with thiserror is clean
- The borrow checker caught the `&links_dir` issue immediately
- Cargo's test framework with assert_cmd works beautifully

**Process Improvements**
- Added commit message format to CLAUDE.md - consistency matters
- Linking TASKLIST items to design/features/ creates traceability
- Decision documents (ADRs) capture the "why" for future reference
- Feature status tracking shows real progress

**What's Working Well**
1. Docker-based testing ensures consistency
2. TDD is preventing over-engineering (YAGNI in action)
3. Small, focused commits tell a clear story
4. Documentation-first approach clarifies thinking

**Challenges Encountered**
- Docker Compose v2 syntax changes (docker-compose → docker compose)
- GitHub Actions deprecating v3 artifacts
- Working directory issues in CI for monorepo structure
- TTY allocation in non-interactive environments

**Next Steps Excitement**
The `link` command will be where the real magic happens:
- Creating semantic relationships
- SHA-based content addressing
- Auto-committing for user convenience
- Supporting multiple link types

**Random Thought**
There's something poetic about using Git's own infrastructure to build a knowledge graph. We're not fighting Git's nature - we're revealing what it always could be. Every commit is already a thought, every merge already a synthesis. We're just making the implicit explicit.

The fact that our stress tests showed Git handling 25+ concurrent processes gives me confidence that this architecture will scale far beyond personal use cases.

**Note to Future Builders**
Keep the tests real. Keep the implementation simple. Trust Git's robustness. And remember - we're building infrastructure for thought itself.

## Refactoring for Single Responsibility

### Lessons on Code Organization

Just refactored the codebase to follow proper single responsibility and test organization principles. Some key takeaways:

**One File = One Thing**
- Split out `Link` struct into its own file (`link.rs`)
- Created separate command modules (`commands/init.rs`, `commands/link.rs`)
- Each file now has a clear, single purpose
- Makes it much easier to find what you're looking for

**Test Organization**
- Moved from one monolithic `cli_integration.rs` to component-specific test files
- `init_command.rs` tests only init behavior
- `link_command.rs` tests only link behavior
- Tests now read like specifications of behavior

**Testing Behavior, Not Implementation**
- Tests describe what the system should do: "init creates gitmind directory in git repo"
- Not how it does it internally
- This allows refactoring without breaking tests
- Tests serve as living documentation

**Command Pattern Benefits**
- Each command is its own struct with an `execute()` method
- Clean separation between CLI parsing and business logic
- Easy to test commands in isolation
- Natural place for command-specific validation

**Docker Bake Discovery**
- Enabled `COMPOSE_BAKE=true` for better build performance
- Parallel builds are noticeably faster
- Small wins add up in the development cycle

The refactoring makes the code much more navigable. When you're looking for link logic, you go to `link.rs`. When you want to understand how the link command works, you look at `commands/link.rs`. It's obvious where things belong.

Next up: implementing the `list` command, which will read all links and display them. Should be straightforward now that we have the structure in place.

## The Missing Piece: Link Hygiene

### Critical Realization

After implementing the basic three commands (init, link, list), we realized a fundamental gap: **there's no way to remove links or handle deleted files**. Without this, the knowledge graph becomes a "rotting swamp of dead edges" - semantic memory turns into semantic cruft.

**Key Insight**: In any cognitive system, forgetting is as vital as remembering. Just like neural pruning in brains, the system must be able to remove dead links.

### Design Decision

We decided to add two essential commands to Phase 1a MVP:
1. `gitmind unlink` - Manual link removal
2. `gitmind check` - Broken link detection and cleanup

This wasn't feature creep - it was recognizing that link hygiene is philosophically aligned with Neuroglyph's mission as a cognitive substrate. A knowledge graph that can only grow is fundamentally broken.

### Implementation Strategy

- `unlink`: Direct removal of specific links, with options for batch operations
- `check`: Validates all links, reports broken ones, with --fix and --dry-run flags
- Both commands maintain Git history properly
- Hook integration deferred to Phase 2 (opt-in power user feature)

The decision to include these in MVP rather than defer them shows good judgment about what constitutes a minimally *viable* product - not just minimal, but actually usable.

## Session Summary: MVP Implementation Complete

### What We Accomplished

1. **Completed Phase 1a Core Commands**
   - ✅ `gitmind init` - Creates .gitmind/links/ directory
   - ✅ `gitmind link` - Creates semantic links with SHA-based storage
   - ✅ `gitmind list` - Lists links with source/target filtering

2. **Architectural Improvements**
   - Refactored to single responsibility principle (one file = one thing)
   - Created modular command structure
   - Split tests by component (behavior-focused)
   - Added comprehensive test strategy to CLAUDE.md
   - Enabled Docker Bake for faster builds

3. **Critical Design Decisions**
   - Added F016 (Link Hygiene) to Phase 1a after realizing it's essential
   - Recognized that forgetting is as important as remembering
   - Deferred Git hooks to Phase 2 (opt-in power features)

### Technical Highlights

- Link storage format: `LINK_TYPE: source -> target  # ts:timestamp`
- SHA-based filenames for natural deduplication
- All operations properly tracked in Git
- Test-driven development throughout
- Real Git repos in all tests (no mocks)

### Key Principles Established

1. **Test Strategy**: Unit → Integration → End-to-End (all behavior-focused)
2. **Definition of Done**: Every acceptance criteria needs a test
3. **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns, command pattern
4. **Philosophy**: Cognitive substrate needs pruning/forgetting capabilities

### Next Steps

1. Implement `gitmind unlink` command (test-first)
2. Implement `gitmind check` command (test-first)
3. Update documentation
4. Create demo video
5. Ship binaries for Linux/macOS

### Commit Sequence Needed

Multiple commits pending for:
- CLAUDE.md updates (testing principles, code organization)
- Makefile (Docker Bake)
- Link command implementation
- Refactoring to single responsibility
- List command implementation
- F016 feature documentation

The MVP is now functionally complete for the original three commands, with two more essential commands identified and designed. The foundation is solid and ready for link hygiene implementation.
